As it does so, the stylus \u201crides\u201d in the grooves carved in the vinyl, which carry the amplitude and frequency of the audio, as well as the left and right stereo information[4]. If your record player has a phono preamp stage, it can be connected to a dedicated phono input on your receiver, which not only raises the level of the signal coming from the cartridge but also applies the RIAA equalization curve to the signal[5]. This equalization curve helps preserve the sonic quality of the original master and allows for the creation of longer LP recording times by keeping the grooves small.[5] </s>"}

In a split-second, the self-driving car senses the trajectory and the likely weight of the oncoming truck. It calculates that a high-impact collision is inevitable, which would kill the five passengers, unless the car swerves towards the pavement on its right-hand side. There, unfortunately, an elderly pedestrian happens to be walking, and he will die as a result if the self-driving car swerves to the right and hits him. This is the sort of situation in which the human passengers of a self-driving car cannot take control quickly enough. So the car itself needs to respond to the situation at hand. And in order for the five passengers in the self-driving car to be saved, as they are likely to be if the head-on collision with the heavy truck is avoided, the car here needs to make a maneuver that will most likely kill one person.', 'This has certain advantages. A self-driving car will not react in the panicky and disorganized ways a human being is apt to react to accident-scenarios. Even in situations of unavoidable collisions, the car\u2019s technology enables significant choices and control-levels regarding how to crash. Based on its sensor inputs and the other information it has access to, the car can calculate the most likely consequences of different trajectories that involve different combinations of braking and swerving.', \"This problem was evident in a fatal accident in March 2018, which involved an autonomous car operated by Uber. The company reported that the vehicle's software identified a pedestrian but deemed it a false positive and failed to swerve to avoid hitting her. This crash caused Toyota to temporarily cease its testing of self-driving cars on public roads, but its testing will continue elsewhere. The Toyota Research Institute is constructing a test facility on a 60-acre site in Michigan to further develop automated vehicle technology.\", 'First, the self-driving car cannot acquire certain knowledge about the truck\u2019s trajectory, its speed at the time of collision, and its actual weight. This creates uncertainty because each of these factors has a strong causal influence on the fatality risk for the passengers of the self-driving car. (Berends 2009; Evans 2001) Moreover, the truck-driver might try to prevent the accident by steering back to her lane. Or if it\u2019s already too late, she might start braking just half a second before the crash (thereby significantly reducing the truck\u2019s speed and impact). The self-driving car\u2019s software can only work with estimates of these alternative courses of events.Footnote 11', '8. Jason Millar argues that the accident-algorithms of self-driving cars ought to be selected by the owner of the car. (Millar 2014) This would mean that different cars could have different accident-algorithms. Two comments: firstly, this would still require a mutual decision since the basic decision to give owners of self-driving cars the right to choose their accident-algorithms would need to be agreed upon by the various different stakeholders involved.

To make this decision, the car must consider the risk of fatality, the potential of the truck-driver to react and prevent the accident, and other factors[1][2][4]. As seen in the Uber accident of 2018, when self-driving cars fail to detect potential hazards or make incorrect decisions, the consequences can be fatal.

While the actual mechanism for this dissipation is also unknown, it is illustrated in this model by precipitation in the same manner as the charge buildup. Charge leaves the cloud at a rate specified by the PRECIPITATION-RATE slider. When the EVAPORATION-RATE equals the PRECIPITATION-RATE the strength of ELECTRIC-FIELD will remain fairly constant.', 'How a charge becomes charged is still an area of active research, but we do know that the top of the cloud becomes positively charged while the bottom of the cloud becomes negatively charged. Two processes that play a role in creating this charge separation are the friction of colliding droplets of water and ice in the cloud and freezing. As the millions and millions of water droplets and ice particles whirl about in the cloud, they collide with rising moisture and in the process knock off electrons (negatively charged particles), leaving the rising water droplets positively charged. The knocked off electrons gather near the bottom of the cloud producing a negative charge, while the positively charged droplets rise toward the top of the cloud. As water droplets rise, they encounter colder air temperatures and start to freeze. The frozen portion of the droplet tends to acquire a negative charge while the unfrozen portion tends to acquire a positive charge.

Yet, the strong electric fields surrounding a cloud are capable of ionizing the surrounding air and making it more conductive. The ionization involves the shredding of electrons from the outer shells of gas molecules. The gas molecules that compose air are thus turned into a soup of positive ions and free electrons. The insulating air is transformed into a conductive plasma. The ability of a storm cloud's electric fields to transform air into a conductor makes charge transfer (in the form of a lightning bolt) from the cloud to the ground (or even to other clouds) possible.\"]\n--------------------\n\n<</SYS>>\n\nWhy does charge build up in a cloud? [/INST] Charge builds up in a cloud due to the friction of colliding droplets of water and ice, as well as freezing[2]. The friction of colliding droplets of water and ice knocks off electrons, leaving the rising water droplets positively charged, while the electrons gather near the bottom of the cloud, producing a negative charge. As water droplets rise, they encounter colder air temperatures and start to freeze, with the frozen portion of the droplet tending to acquire a negative charge, and the unfrozen portion tending to acquire a positive charge[2]. As the static charge buildup in the storm cloud increases, the electric field surrounding the cloud becomes stronger and can ionize the surrounding air and make it more conductive, allowing for charge transfer from the cloud to the ground or to other clouds[5]. </s>"}

Thus, a combination of geomagnetic imprinting and magnetic navigation similar to that outlined previously for continental nesting sites might suffice in some cases. Alternatively or additionally, a more complex strategy, such as imprinting on two elements of the field and using some form of bi-coordinate magnetic navigation, might also be feasible in some situations (Lohmann et al., 1999, 2007, 2008a). Simulations have indicated that a strategy of using magnetic navigation to arrive in the vicinity of an island, and then using chemical cues to pinpoint it, is plausible even for very small, remote islands, and even when significant secular variation occurs (Endres et al., 2016). Additional environmental cues such as the sound of waves breaking or the pattern of waves refracting around an island might also help turtles locate islands once they have drawn near (Lohmann et al., 1999, 2008c).', 'Although most beaches with large numbers of nesting sea turtles are located along continental coastlines, some turtle populations nest on islands. From an evolutionary perspective, island-nesting populations are thought to be derived from turtles that originally nested on continents (Bowen and Karl, 2007). Whether turtles in the two groups use the same mechanisms to locate their natal areas is not known. Alternative strategies of navigation and imprinting might have evolved to facilitate island nesting; indeed, the mechanisms used by any population to return to a natal area might depend in part on what is effective in a particular geographic setting (Lohmann et al., 2007, 2008a).', 'A particularly convincing demonstration that turtles can use magnetic navigation to move toward a distant goal has come from experiments with juvenile green turtles. Turtles of this age show fidelity to coastal feeding sites and return to them after seasonal migrations or experimental displacements (Ireland, 1980; Avens et al., 2003; Avens and Lohmann, 2004). Juvenile turtles were tethered to a tracking system inside a pool of water located on land but very close to their offshore feeding area on the Atlantic coast of Florida (Lohmann et al., 2004). Turtles were then exposed to magnetic fields that exist at locations 340 km north or south of the feeding site. Individuals exposed to the northern field swam south, whereas those exposed to the southern field swam north (Fig. 3). Thus, turtles behaved as if they were trying to return home from the locations where the two fields actually exist. These findings imply that, well before the turtles mature, they have already acquired a \u2018magnetic map\u2019 (Lohmann et al., 2007) that can be used for navigation toward distant coastal locations.', 'Additional evidence that nesting female turtles seek out magnetic signatures has emerged from studies of population genetics (Shamblin et al., 2011; Lohmann et al., 2013; Brothers and Lohmann, 2018). Analyses have revealed that loggerhead turtles that nest at similar latitudes but on opposite sides of the Florida peninsula are often genetically similar despite their geographic distance from each other (Shamblin et al., 2011). Given that the magnetic fields at latitudinally similar locations on opposite sides of Florida are similar, an interesting possibility is that this population structure has arisen as a consequence of errors in magnetic navigation during natal homing (Shamblin et al., 2011; Lohmann et al., 2013). In other words, if turtles seek out the magnetic signature of their natal beach, but sometimes mistakenly nest on a different beach with a similar magnetic signature, then the genetic pattern can be readily explained. Consistent with this possibility, some loggerhead turtles nest in widely separated locations during their lifetimes, including sites on both the east and west coasts of Florida (Bjorndal et al., 1983).', 'Evidence for a magnetic map in green turtles. (A) A juvenile green turtle swimming in a magnetic navigation experiment. Turtles were placed into soft cloth harnesses and tethered to an electronic tracking device that monitored their orientation as they swam in a water-filled arena surrounded by a magnetic coil system (Lohmann et al., 2004). (B) Juvenile turtles were captured in feeding grounds near the test site in Florida. Each turtle was exposed to a magnetic field that exists at one of two distant locations along the coastline (represented by blue dots). Turtles exposed to the field from the northern site swam approximately southward, whereas those exposed to the field from the southern site swam approximately northward. In the orientation diagrams, each dot represents the mean angle of a single turtle. The arrow in the center of each circle represents the mean angle of the group.

The slower airflow is caused by the tissue inside swelling with increased blood flow.', 'But why do we have two noses? Is it because we are bilaterally symmetrical with two arms, two legs, two of most organs? Could one nostril be more beautiful and function better? Surely a single large nostril placed in the centre of the face could function as effectively as is the case for the mouth where one opening serves us very well. It could take us a little while to appreciate the beauty of a single nostril as opposed to the beauty of our paired and smaller nostrils but I feel this would grow on us, especially us physiologists, as a single large nostril would have better aerodynamics and offer less resistance to airflow than our two smaller nostrils. The nose does present a considerable resistance to airflow- around two thirds of the resistance to airflow of the whole airway from nostril to alveoli. Most of the work of breathing is related to moving air through the nose and this is the price we pay for filtering and conditioning the air we breathe.', 'Another reason we have two nostrils is because of something called the \"nasal cycle\".

The sensation of spiciness is produced when pain receptors are activated in the tongue. Capsaicin is a member of the vanilloid family of molecules, and it binds to a receptor on the tongue. When capsaicin binds to the VR1 receptor, it produces the same sensation as heat, which explains why it burns.', 'So spiciness is basically a combination of the pain and burning sensation that you get when you eat spicy food!

[/INST] No, if you have no sense of taste, you cannot feel the heat or spiciness from something like a pepper. The heat or spiciness from the pepper is not a taste, but rather a neurological response caused by the pepper's membrane releasing capsaicin, a chemical compound that clamps onto your mouth's neurotransmitters, which regulate temperature[1]. This false alert your brain interprets as a blast of heat, without damaging any tissue or taste buds[1]. </s>"}

The difference with the torque in a plane versus a helicopter is how the vehicle responds to it. In a helicopter, the torque causes the helicopter to want to yaw in the opposite direction that the main rotor is spinning. This is why the tail rotor pushes the tail in the opposite direction. In a plane, it causes the plane to tend to roll in the opposite direction than the propeller is spinning. The way a pilot fixes this is by adjusting the ailerons on the plane in the opposite direction slightly. This counters the torque applied by the propeller.', '\u00b7 The second type of RC helicopter has a tail rotor and one individual rotor. Because there is just one motor on this kind of helicopter, also known as a coaxial helicopter, the tail rotor is necessary to balance out the rotor and the tail, so the aircraft moves straight.

When this system malfunctions, your helicopter will start spinning uncontrollably.', 'This prevents the helicopter from turning in circles during flight and keeps it steady.

When city officials tell you to not waste water, they mean that you should not needlessly divert water from the human-usable part of the water cycle to the non-human-usable part of the water cycle. According to the book \"Water in Crisis\" edited by Peter H. Gleick, only 0.77% of the water on the earth is in the form of fresh, liquid water in and on the ground. The rest is in salty oceans and lakes, locked up as ice, or in the atmosphere. Letting water run down the sink while you grab a snack typically sends that water right out of the part of the water cycle that is accessible and usable by humans. With this in mind, wasting water does not directly hurt the global environment, since the water is not destroyed. Rather, wasting water hurts humans, as it leaves them with less accessible, usable water. Additionally, wasting too much water can hurt the local environment as it drains too much usable water away from the natural ecosystem.', \"What is the human-usable portion of the water cycle? The answer is: fresh liquid water on or near the surface of the earth. Humans cannot survive drinking salt water, so pumping untreated water directly in from the oceans and from salt lakes is not an option. It's true that salty ocean water can be converted to fresh water through distillation or reverse osmosis, but these processes are relatively costly so that they are not economically feasible in most parts of the world. For most regions, the ocean is simply not a viable source of human-usable water. Similarly, water in the atmosphere is not a reasonable source of water for human consumption. While the water in the air and in the clouds is fresh water, it is widely dispersed and is hard to collect. Humans must therefore wait for the water in the oceans to evaporate into the atmosphere and then rain or snow back down to the ground. The places near or on the surface where rainwater and snowmelt collect are the places that constitute the human-usable portion of the water cycle. These places include freshwater rivers, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and groundwater.\", 'Parents, city officials, and environmentalists seem to be often telling us, \"Don\\'t waste water!\" and \"Conserve water!\".

Since the late 1970s, unemployment is the primary problem for social-economic policy in all welfare states. In Basic Income, Unemployment and Compensatory Justice it is argued that implementing a substantial basic income is the best policy response to deal with unemployment-induced problems such as job insecurity, social exclusion, poverty and lack of compensatory justice on the labour market and to improve labour market flexibility, boost low wage employment and part-time work. Basic Income, Unemployment and Compensatory Justice, with an introductory chapter by Philippe van Parijs, discusses the attractiveness of a substantial basic income to deal with the problem of unemployment, in combination with an ethical perspective of social justice.', 'In summary, at any level of human capital, workers might not find jobs that suit their skills/diplomas because of the lack of work experience and/or difficulties signaling these skills (long-term unemployment can also bring observed skills below their potential6). Their reservation wages are likely to be higher than the wage offers they receive to compensate for their learning needs. In part, this is because lower productivity jobs could pay more. But other factors (not taken into account in our simple model) such as family support or expectations about fair wages for a given set of skills can also increase reservation wages. Workers would then prefer to wait and remain unemployed seeking for better job offers, or eventually settle in lower productivity jobs where there would be less learning7. Clearly, one can argue that rational individuals would understand that they are better off over the long term by taking the higher productivity jobs and accepting the lower wages. They could, for instance, borrow to help support the period of on the job training at low pay and then repay the loan when their salaries increase. But even if individuals had the right foresight, access to credit is often not an option, particularly, among worker with no job history or who have been through long periods of unemployment.', 'Goos and Konings (2007) also used firm data to evaluate the payroll subsidies for manual workers in Belgium, and found significant effects on employment. A careful analysis of the Finnish payroll subsidy for older, low-wage workers by Huttunen et al. (2010) found mixed results: the subsidy had no significant effect on employment or the probability of leaving a job, but produced a 2 percent increase in the hours of work for employees in the industrial sector (but not the service sector) by increasing the probability that a part-time worker would become full-time by 7 percent. At the same time, the subsidy reduced hourly earnings of industrial workers by 2 percent, just offsetting the effect of the increase in hours on earnings.', 'There have been several evaluations of the French system, in which payroll taxes are reduced for low-wage workers; the subsidy is phased out as wages rise. Using household data, Kramarz and Philippon (2001) compared workers affected by changes in the minimum wage or the payroll tax subsidy when those policies changed with workers just above that level. They found that increases in the minimum wage reduced employment, but found no evidence of increased employment when the payroll tax subsidy was increased. Crepon and Desplatz (2002) used firm data to estimate the effects of different levels of the payroll tax on total employment at the firm level. They found that larger subsidies were indeed correlated with faster growth in total employment (in cross-section), but their data did not allow them to distinguish between growth in low-wage jobs and growth in high-wage jobs.', 'Most of these studies do not distinguish between the employment effects while the wage subsidy is being received, as predicted by the static model, and the longer-term employment effects generated by greater work experience and, therefore, higher productivity, as predicted by the dynamic model discussed in the previous section. However, the studies cited earlier, by Orr et al. (1996), Bell et al. (1999), strongly imply that the employment effects of wage subsidies persist long after the subsidy expires. In another study Heckman et al. (2002) posit a model of \u201clearning by doing\u201d in which time spent working increases human capital and contrast it with a model of \u201con-the-job training\u201d, which entails a tradeoff between working and training and, therefore, forgone earnings. Using changes in earnings induced by changes in the structure of the U.S. Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), they show that under a model of learning by doing, the EITC increases workers\u2019 lifetime earnings, whereas under the formal training model, the EITC actually reduces earnings, once the tradeoff between work and training is taken into account14.']\n--------------------\n\n<</SYS>>\n\nWhy does Basic Income Decrease \"Werkgelegenheid\" and is this the same metric as \"Job Opportunities\"? [/INST] Implementing a substantial basic income has been argued to reduce \"werkgelegenheid\" (employment) in order to improve labour market flexibility, boost low wage employment and part-time work[1]. This is because workers may not find jobs that suit their skills due to the lack of work experience and/or difficulties signaling their skills, which may cause their reservation wages to be higher than wage offers they receive[2]. Additionally, research has found that payroll subsidies for manual workers, such as the Finnish payroll subsidy for older, low-wage workers, can reduce hours of work and hourly earnings[3]. Other studies have also found that increases in the minimum wage reduce employment, but found no evidence of increased employment when the payroll tax subsidy was increased[4]. Finally, there is evidence that the employment effects of wage subsidies persist long after the subsidy expires, as it increases workers' lifetime earnings[4][5]. \"Job opportunities\" is a different metric, which refers to the percentage of people who are actively seeking a job who are able to find one. </s>"}

However, other countries, such as China, Cuba, Iran, Russia, Syria, and Turkey, recognized the election result.[1] </s>"}

It has a ridged texture to it and responds to gentle stroking. The G-spot is also known as the female prostate gland, and unlike the male prostate gland, which has only two ducts, the G-spot has over 32 much smaller ducts.

It is a sensitive area that may be part of the female prostate, has a ridged texture to it and responds to gentle stroking[2][5]. However, it varies from person to person and other factors may play a role in whether or not a female can find the G-spot or identify a specific spot as their G-spot[4]. </s>"}

If the energy isn't absorbed, it has nowhere to go but back to the magnetron to damage it\u2014which, again, can render your microwave useless.\", 'That doesn\u2019t mean metal can\u2019t get hot; it can. It contains electrons that are attracted to the microwaves, too. But without something to efficiently absorb the energy this attraction produces (i.e., food), the metal transfers it to whatever\u2019s nearby \u2014 namely, the internal circuitry of your oven, resulting in overheating and possibly fire.', 'So is it safe to use any metal at all in the microwave? Well, you might not have noticed, but there already is a bunch of metal in your microwave. The walls and circuitry are mostly metal, and the door has a mesh built in that lets visible light out, but reflects microwaves back in. This shielding is important. Not only are your leftovers mostly made of water, but so are you, and it\u2019d be a drag to cook yourself before the meatloaf\u2019s done. (Microwave burns are a real thing, but you have to turn to fiction if you want extreme microwave havoc: Infinite Jest tells of a grisly head-in-microwave suicide.) On a smaller scale, faulty shielding can lead to microwave bursts strong enough to fool radio telescope astronomers.', \"We've all heard that it's not safe to put metal in the microwave. But the fact of the matter is, we often put metals in the microwave\u2014like when we heat up a Hot Pocket, for example. Its pouch has a thin layer of aluminum lining that is designed to absorb the microwaves and heat up a bit to brown the outside of the Hot Pocket.\", 'Second, if the metal you put in the microwave is pointed (like a fork), has sharp corners (like crumpled aluminum foil), or is thin (like the decorative gold on your fancy teacup), then the electrons moved around by the microwaves can bunch up along the edges. When too much charge builds in one spot, those electrons get very unhappy. And unhappy electrons are liable to\u2014zap!\u2014jump through the air to find a better spot. (That static electric shock you get by shuffling across the carpet and touching a doorknob? Same thing.) While a little bit of sparking between the tines of a fork probably won\u2019t cause long-term damage, larger sparks between the metal and the case are where the trouble starts. Throw a little bit of paper or something flammable in there, and your mother\u2019s fiery disaster prediction will come true.']\n--------------------\n\n<</SYS>>\n\nwhy you can't put metal in the microwave but nothing happens to the metal that it's built from [/INST] Putting metal in the microwave can be dangerous because the microwaves can cause the electrons in the metal to become energized and create sparks that can damage the internal circuitry of the microwave[1][5]. Additionally, the metal can reflect the microwaves back to the magnetron, which can damage it, rendering your microwave useless[1][3]. There is metal in the microwave already, such as the walls and circuitry, and the door has a mesh built in that helps to shield and contain the microwaves[3][5]. When using metal in the microwave, it is important to make sure that the metal is not pointed, has no sharp corners, and is not too thin, in order to prevent sparking[3][5]. Additionally, some metals, such as aluminum, are designed to absorb the microwaves and heat up, such as the pouch on a Hot Pocket[4]. </s>"}
