{"answer": "The point of wasting the first two plays with a rush up the middle is to take advantage of the 40 second play clock and the two minute warning in professional and college football games. By running the ball directly up the middle, the offense hopes to be able to block everyone up and the running back can make a person miss and end up in the end zone[2]. Running up the middle is also the shortest path to the end zone, so it is often designed to move defensive players out of the way[3]. Additionally, running the ball up the middle enough times will cause linebackers and defensive backs to run toward the line of scrimmage, creating the perfect opportunity to throw the ball over their heads or in vacated areas[4]. This strategy is used to keep possession of the ball as long as possible rather than attempting to score[2][5]."}
{"answer": "The 10 cent difference between the different tiers of gas prices is likely due to a convention established by gas stations, which is likely done to make the prices easier for customers to understand and remember. The 10 cent difference does not necessarily reflect the actual difference in quality between the different types of gas, as premium gas is higher grade fuel that can cost up to 50 cents more per gallon, while gas that meets Top Tier standards is more expensive by only 3 cents per gallon[3]. According to national averages, the price difference between regular and premium gasoline is approximately 20 to 25 percent, or 50 cents per gallon[4], and the gap between premium and regular gas has been steadily rising since 2009, with the most dramatic increase occurring in the last two years[5]."}
{"answer": "The visibility of stars from a specific location depends on several factors, including the declination of the star and the latitude of the observer, the observer's topology, the magnitude of the star, weather conditions, and whether the Earth is flat or round[2]. The maximum number of stars visible from a city on a clear night is between 2,500 and 5,000[1]. Stellar brightness is based on the apparent visual magnitude as perceived by the human eye, from the brightest stars of 1st magnitude to the faintest at 6th magnitude[4]. Multiple star systems are indicated by parentheses showing the individual magnitudes of component stars, such as the binary star system Alpha Centauri, which has a total or combined magnitude of \u22120.27, while its two component stars have magnitudes of +0.01 and +1.33[4]."}
{"answer": "It is difficult to know for sure that the money the government is getting from bank settlements is going back to the people. The settlement service is supported by a well-established legal framework primarily based on rules, operating procedures, contractual agreements, laws and regulations[2]. However, banks are the only entities allowed to participate in the settlement system and must comply with requirements for participation in the Reserve Bank Settlement System[5]. Additionally, each individual bank or financial institution will decide to release the money or not release it to the person acting in the estate of the deceased[4]. Therefore, it is ultimately up to the banks to ensure that the money is going back to the people."}
{"answer": "The good sides of manual transmission are that you can get more speed since it is better at transferring power from your engine to your wheels[5], and that it can keep you alert during long drives since you need to shift gears[2]. The good sides of automatic transmission are that the transition between gears is smoother and more comfortable[2], and with dual-clutch technology it can be quicker[5]. The bad sides of manual transmission is that lazy driving can result in a bumpy ride[1][2][4], and the bad sides of automatic transmission is that driving it in manual mode can potentially cause damage to the transmission, wearing it out faster and resulting in premature and expensive repairs being necessary[1]."}
{"answer": "Muscles grow through a process called skeletal muscle hypertrophy, which adds more myosin filaments to each muscle fiber, making the engine of the cell bigger and stronger over time[1]. This is achieved through increased muscle tension and physical stress, breaking down muscle fiber[3]. Muscle growth is also a direct consequence of resistance training and nutrition[2]. People build muscle at different rates depending on their age, sex, and genetics, but muscle development significantly increases if exercise is done correctly and the body stores more protein through a process called protein synthesis[4]."}
{"answer": "A precipitation reaction is a type of ionic reaction in which two (or more) soluble salts react to form an insoluble product, also known as a precipitate[3]. This takes the form of a double replacement reaction, in which two soluble salts exchange cations and anions to form an insoluble product[5]. Examples of precipitation reactions include the reaction between calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide, resulting in an insoluble salt called calcium hydroxide[2][4] and the reaction between potassium chloride and silver nitrate, in which solid silver chloride is precipitated out[4]."}
{"answer": "No, defense attorneys cannot 'throw' a case if they know their clients are guilty. Most of the time, criminal defense attorneys lose their cases because police and prosecutors do their jobs well and obtain enough evidence to convict[1]. Even when everyone knows the client is guilty, the jury may still have to ignore the evidence if it was found using illegal methods[2]. Defense attorneys want the best possible outcome for their clients, and many are in defense because they see the criminal justice system as terrible, so they may strive to keep their client out of prison[3]. Additionally, defense lawyers often do not ask their clients if they committed the crime and leave the question of guilt up to the judge or jury[4]. If a lawyer knows their client is guilty, they must make an application to the judge to have themselves removed from the case and a new lawyer will be appointed[4][5]."}
{"answer": "The spins are a common side effect of binge drinking, caused by impairments in vision and equilibrioception (sense of balance)[2][3]. The spinning is caused by your inebriated brain telling your eyes that you're still upright, and that it should use your rectus muscles (the muscles which control the roll of your eye) to right your vision[1]. When you close your eyes, your brain is still trying to right your vision, which creates the feeling of spinning, but when you open your eyes the signal is strong enough for your brain to stop trying to correct your vision, which stops the spinning[1]."}
{"answer": "Some fish bones are edible, while others are not. Fish bones contain nutrients and are sometimes eaten on a routine basis in some parts of the world[1]. However, most of the time they are avoided because they pose a choking hazard[2]. Additionally, when eating fish bones as part of the whole fish, as with sardines, you won\u2019t taste them separately from the fish[4]. Fish bones are sometimes boiled with the fish flesh to create a soup, but in general, they are mostly avoided[5]."}
{"answer": "Thinking about a movement and actually moving it involve different brain chemistry. When imagining a movement, research has shown that it activates and builds the same brain circuits as actually moving does[2]. However, when actually moving, specific commands to motor neurons and muscles are sent from the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord[5], which controls the movement of the arm. Additionally, some movement may need to be forced in order for the arm to move, such as in the case of a stroke patient."}
{"answer": "There are several reasons why healthy food often tastes bad while unhealthy food tastes good. One is that our taste buds are used to sweet, salty, and savory flavors, so many healthy foods taste bitter or sour to us[1]. Another is that our taste buds adapt to what we eat, so if we eat a lot of unhealthy foods, our taste buds will start to prefer those flavors[2][4]. Additionally, unhealthy foods are often packed with sugar, salt and unhealthy fats, which can make them taste much more appealing than healthy foods[2][5]. Another reason is that we are not used to eating healthy food, so our taste buds have to adjust to the new flavors of fresh fruits and vegetables[1][4]. Lastly, it is also an evolutionary reason, as ancient humans had an abundance of plants around them, so their body didn\u2019t need to develop a mechanism which would spur them to eat more plants[5]. The combination of salt, fat, and sugar triggers serotonin, which sends our brains into a pleasure overdrive, but it is simply too much and inflicts irreparable harm on our body[5]."}
{"answer": "When you press your eyes, it causes physical force to be applied to the light detectors at the back of your eyes[2], which can create phosphenes. These phosphenes are bright spots of light or strange twisting spirals, and can be experienced as flickering white light if you hit your head[4]. They can also be experienced as different colours when you\u2019re gently rubbing your eyes[5], caused by the extra pressure on the cells that detect light[5]."}
{"answer": "An island is a body of land surrounded by water, smaller than a continent, and not connected to a mainland[1][2][3][4]. Islands may be classified as either continental or oceanic[2]. Oceanic islands are those that rise to the surface from the floors of the ocean basins while continental islands are unsubmerged parts of the continental shelf that are entirely surrounded by water[2]. The list of island countries includes 50 island countries and 44 island territories[3][5]. Australia is not included as it is considered a continent, although it was historically referred to as an island because of its lack of land borders[5]."}
{"answer": "People may like getting drunk/sloshed/hammered/shit-faced because it helps them forget their worries and relax. Being hammered is a term that is more often used when people refer to parties, and it usually refers to a good night of drinking with a group of friends. The term may have originated from laborers who would come home and hit the sauce to put their work cares behind them[5]. There are an estimated 300 to 3000 words in the English language that mean drunk, so people have plenty of slang words to choose from to describe the experience[4]."}
{"answer": "When a \"too-big-to-fail\" bank goes bankrupt, it can put the entire financial system at risk, leading governments to step in and provide a bailout[1]. This creates an economic distortion known as moral hazard, as the bank does not bear all the costs of its activities and is likely to take too many risks[1]. The existence of banks that are too big to fail is also associated with systemic risk externalities and creates an undesirable economic distortion[1][5]. Additionally, having large banks that are deemed \"too big to fail\" allows them to pay lower interest rates to depositors and investors than small banks are obliged to pay[3]."}
{"answer": "The debate over encryption and government access to secured communications has been ongoing for decades, with the most recent debate being sparked by the San Bernardino shooting in 2015[3]. Since then, the push for stronger encryption has been marching on and the heat surrounding the Apple-FBI standoff has subsided[2]. However, the debate remains relevant as government authorities continue to argue that encryption used by companies like Apple makes it harder for them to solve cases and stop terrorist attacks[5]."}
{"answer": "Beer on tap almost always tastes better than it does from a bottle for a variety of reasons. When a beer takes its journey through a draft line, it is pushed with carbon dioxide and/or nitrogen, and comes out with the perfect amount of carbonation which creates a fluffy head and a crisp mouthfeel[1]. Also, some breweries have a slightly different recipe for their bottled beer than their draft[2]. Additionally, beer from the tap is usually fresher than the bottled or canned product, and freshness impacts flavor[3]. In addition, draft beer has always been considered better than bottled beer, as some people say it\u2019s because it\u2019s colder, or just simply better[4]. Finally, the experience of drinking bottled beer with friends is more satisfying and enjoyable than drinking from aluminum cans or bottles[5]."}
{"answer": "It is possible to build up an immunity to some poisons, both naturally occurring and man-made, through a process called mithridatism. Mithridatism is generally only effective with biologically complex types of poison, which the immune system can respond to[2]. Examples of natural toxins include those found in plants, through the infestation of toxin-producing mould, or through ingestion of toxin-producing microorganisms[3]. There are also poisonous substances that occur naturally in the ground, such as asbestos and lead[4]. Poisons are of microbial, plant, animal, or synthetic origin[5]."}
{"answer": "Devices can estimate the amount of charge left in a battery by measuring the voltage[1][2][3][4][5], estimating the current (Coulomb Counting)[2][3][4][5], and estimation from internal impedance measurements[2][3]. Coulomb Counting works by measuring the current entering (when it\u2019s being charged) and leaving (when it\u2019s being discharged) the cells and integrating this over time. This technique of determining the SOC is aptly called \u2018Coulomb counting\u2019, since it counts the charge entering/leaving the cells[4][5]."}
{"answer": "Cold-water immersion (CWI) is sometimes used to manage muscle soreness after exercise and to speed up recovery time[3]. According to research, cold water immersion may suppress inflammation, hinder muscle fiber growth, and delay muscle regeneration[2]. Dr Chris Bleakley also stated that immersing yourself in cold water after exercise can reduce muscle soreness, but only compared to resting or doing nothing[1][4]. This is supported by a study which looked into the effects of cold-water immersion in the management of muscle soreness after exercise[5]."}
{"answer": "There are several reasons why we like watching the same TV show or movie over and over again. One is that repetition breeds affection, and we tend to enjoy something more if we\u2019ve been previously exposed to it[1]. This is known as the \u2018mere exposure effect\u2019, which explains that familiar things are easier to process[1]. Another reason is that familiar content requires less mental effort to process and enjoy[1][3]. Additionally, watching the same film over and over again leads us to find details in our favorite scenes and to feel the comfort and pleasure of being in a warm and safe environment[4]. There is also a deeper explanation behind this behavior that goes beyond mere amusement or pleasure[5]."}
{"answer": "The Beatles broke up due to a combination of factors. John Lennon wanted to dissolve the partnership and begin the separation process[3], which caused Paul McCartney to \"let the cat out of the bag\"[2]. A judge decided that McCartney's request for dissolution was proper[3], and the remaining Beatles' contract with their manager, Allen Klein, ended in 1973[3]. The Beatles had grown tired of Klein and sued him for fraud[2][3]. The seeds of the Beatles split were sown the minute they stopped being a performing band in August 1966[4], and when the time came for the Beatles to sign the final dissolution to the old partnership, Lennon refused to appear[3], likely due to worries about the money and the fact that the Beatles were truly over with. McCartney described the breakup as the \u201cmost difficult period of my life\u201d and said he could have imagined the Beatles continuing for longer if Lennon had not instigated the split[3][5]."}
{"answer": "Mobile phones are built differently than other small appliances and are designed to dissipate heat away from the internal components without the need for cooling vents. This is done through the use of advanced cooling mechanisms, the back of the device to dissipate heat away from the internal components[2], and the use of high-end cooling systems[3]. Older phones may be susceptible to inefficient cooling due to the wear of thermal paste and other factors[4], but this can be prevented through adjusting settings and usage patterns. Additionally, smartphones and smart tablets contain components that generate heat, but do not require cooling vents because no part of the device becomes extremely hot[5]."}
{"answer": "Putting metallic objects in the microwave is bad because the microwaves will bounce off the object and not heat the food, which can cause sparks to come out of the object and damage the microwave[1]. The surface charge density of objects with sharp edges or pointed tips is higher and may generate higher potential differences, resulting in the breakdown of the air and possible fire[3]. Metal is bad at absorbing microwaves and some energy from the microwaves can transfer to the internal circuitry of the oven, resulting in overheating and possibly fire[4]. In addition, metal generally reflects microwaves, so thick metal may heat up slowly and spark[5]."}
{"answer": "Our ancestors had a highly developed sense of taste and a highly developed sensorial system that allowed them to discern between poisonous and safe foods[3]. Additionally, they had an instinctive fear of strangers and unknown dangers, which helped them to avoid eating poisonous foods. However, due to rapid industrial and technological advances, our evolutionary instincts have not had the chance to catch up, so we lack the same instincts our ancestors had[2]."}
{"answer": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared that any appointment by the sitting president to be null and void, and that the next Supreme Court justice should be chosen by the next president[3]. This has led to a contentious debate and contested votes, with the Senate floor often being empty as a result. Despite this, the Senate has recently voted to bring Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court nomination to the floor for a final vote[4]. This shows that presidents can, and do, behave strategically with respect to Supreme Court nominations, while being constrained by the presence of continuing justices and the existing Court median[5]."}
{"answer": "Insecticides in bug spray work by attacking the insect's gut and killing them when ingested[4]. Insect repellents work by disguising the scent of humans, making us invisible or unattractive to insects[2]. Insect repellents can also repel bugs by having strong scents[5]."}
{"answer": "There are several factors that can slow down internet speeds. These include having gadgets with slower internet technology, running background programs[2], using more bandwidth than your plan allows[3], equipment damage[4], an outdated router or a less-than-ideal router location[5], and bandwidth throttling by the internet service provider[5]."}
{"answer": "Reducing GUI effects can impact performance because the Windows GUI, for example, being your desktop, is rendered on the CPU, not the GPU[2]. Therefore, reducing effects improves performance as the CPU is not designed specifically for rendering[2]. Additionally, reducing GUI effects can reduce the strain on the GPU as the number of pixels on the screen is decreased[5]."}
{"answer": "If you do not pay your US Federal income tax, the IRS will charge you a failure-to-pay penalty, which is generally 0.5 percent of your unpaid taxes for each month you don't pay, up to 25 percent[1]. In addition, interest will accrue on your unpaid taxes at a rate equal to the federal short-term rate, plus 3 percent[1]. Ignoring the taxes you owe is not a good idea, as the IRS can take money out of your wages or your bank account, issue federal tax liens, and destroy your credit[4]. Therefore, if you cannot pay your taxes, it is best to file your taxes and then work out a payment plan with the IRS[2][5]."}
{"answer": "Employers require a voided personal check in order to setup direct deposit because it provides all the information necessary to deposit money in your checking account[1]. If you need to provide a voided check, you can take a check from your checkbook and write \"void\" across it in large letters and provide the check to your employer[3]. Although there is no rule or regulation that requires a voided check to sign up for direct deposit[4], it is a common practice in many HR departments and payroll processing firms throughout the US[4]."}
{"answer": "Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is dependent on or derived from an underlying asset, such as the price of a stock, a commodity such as gold or even interest rates[3]. In a real sense, derivatives are just a side bet between market participants on what\u2019s going to happen in the markets[1]. The total value of derivatives outstanding is estimated at $610 trillion[4]. People make money off derivatives by speculating on the value of the underlying asset in future[5]."}
{"answer": "The American accent is the result of multiple waves of immigration throughout US history. The elite British rulers introduced their non-rhotic speech in America, which influenced the Traditional American English[2]. Slaves brought from West Africa led to the development of African American Vernacular English, which formed the basis of accents for African Americans[2]. German, Scandinavian and Russian immigrants all had their own distinct impacts on the American accent as well[2]. Today, what is termed as the American accent is an umbrella accent that lacks certain noticeable sociolinguistic salient features, such as non-rhotic speech and ethnic features[4]."}
{"answer": "VHS tapes can lose their quality over time due to several factors. The tape inside the VHS cassettes is very delicate and can be easily ruined, making them unplayable and unrepairable, as the magnetic charge needed for them to work is not permanent and the magnetic particles end up losing their charge in a process known as remanence decay[1]. Additionally, VHS tapes have moving parts, making them more prone to malfunction, and tape slippage can occur due to the tape losing its tension or becoming warped, which can be caused by storing them at high temperatures or frequent changes in humidity[2]. VHS tapes can also deteriorate over time from infrequent or overuse, leading to scratches and technical difficulties[3]. Lastly, tapes can experience \u201cfuzzy\u201d syndrome due to mold, dust, grime, overuse, and underuse[4], and newer mini DVs and Digital 8 tapes can suffer from digital corruption, meaning that the footage becomes lost and cannot be recovered[5]."}
{"answer": "It is not possible to produce O3 and pump it into the atmosphere to fix the problem faster because O3 molecules in the stratosphere are constantly being produced and destroyed by different types of UV radiation from the sun[2]. These UV radiation cause certain chemicals to break apart and release chlorine or bromine atoms, which in turn destroy ozone molecules[2]. The oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecules to form more ozone[2][3]. This reaction is also catalysed by the presence of certain free radicals, such as hydroxyl, nitric oxide and atomic chlorine and bromine[5]. The increase of CFCs and similar chlorinated and brominated organic molecules in the atmosphere has caused stratospheric ozone concentrations to decline, which is why the 1987 Montreal Protocol was created to ban the production of many ozone depleting chemicals[5]."}
{"answer": "Gene therapy is a technique that uses a gene(s) to treat, prevent or cure a disease or medical disorder[1][4]. It works by adding new copies of a gene that is broken, or by replacing a defective or missing gene in a patient\u2019s cells with a healthy version of that gene[1]. The genetic material that is delivered, DNA or RNA, has instructions to change how a protein\u2014or group of proteins\u2014is produced by the cell[2]. Gene therapy is an experimental treatment using genetic material to treat or prevent certain diseases[1][2][3]. It is a medical approach that treats or prevents disease by correcting the underlying genetic problem[4]. It is when DNA is introduced into a patient to treat a genetic disease[1][2][5]."}
{"answer": "Yes, it is possible to be a 'man without a country', as illustrated in the 1863 short story by American writer Edward Everett Hale entitled \"The Man Without a Country\"[2]. The story tells of American Army lieutenant Philip Nolan, who renounces his country during a trial for treason and is consequently sentenced to spend the rest of his days at sea without so much as a word of news about the United States[2]. The story has been adapted for the screen several times, including a 1917 short film, a 1937 short film, and a 1973 TV movie[5]."}
{"answer": "A record's groove is actually V-shaped and carries one of the stereo signals on each side of the groove wall. The frequency and amplitude (volume) information are a reflection of the groove\u2019s width and depth[1]. The groove is like a fingerprint of the sound waves captured in a lacquer disc and is a recording of how the sound waves behave as they move through the air[2]. A record's groove is tiny, usually around 0.04-0.08mm wide, and if you were to unravel it, the groove on a 12-inch LP would extend to a length of about 500 metres[3]. The stylus, which is a needle made of a hard substance like a small piece of industrial diamond, sits on the end of a tone arm mounted on the record player and follows the grooves and spirals inward as the record spins. As it does so, the stylus \u201crides\u201d in the grooves carved in the vinyl, which carry the amplitude and frequency of the audio, as well as the left and right stereo information[4]. If your record player has a phono preamp stage, it can be connected to a dedicated phono input on your receiver, which not only raises the level of the signal coming from the cartridge but also applies the RIAA equalization curve to the signal[5]. This equalization curve helps preserve the sonic quality of the original master and allows for the creation of longer LP recording times by keeping the grooves small.[5]"}
{"answer": "When a word can belong to two different contractions, the priority is given to the more formal version of the contraction. Contractions should be avoided in formal texts and the original two words should be used instead. Contractions are typically formed by adding a contracted suffix, usually beginning with an apostrophe, to another word[2]. Contractions act as a single word and have a definite spelling[1], but two different contractions can be spelled the same, such as I would and I had, which are both contracted as I\u2019d[1]."}
{"answer": "Eating things from other planets or moons is an interesting concept and is not currently possible. However, it could become possible in the future. There are a number of things to consider when considering what food would be available on other planets or moons. For example, the wavelength of available light, the composition of the soil, the gravitational pull, the atmospheric pressure, and other environmental nuances would all affect the food available. Foods would also have to be specially treated to preserve them and prevent bacteria and other microbes from growing on them[3]. Additionally, \u201ceating healthy\u201d would be a little different in space, as astronauts would need to take into account the zero-gravity environment, and some foods could be dangerous in space, such as bread and other foods that make crumbs[3]. Finally, experts have warned that humans could end up eating each other if crops fail when we finally set up colonies in space[4]."}
{"answer": "The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 was a direct and dangerous confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War[1][3][4][5]. The crisis began when Cuba allowed the Soviet Union to secretly install nuclear missiles on the island following a botched CIA attempt to topple the Fidel Castro regime, known as the Bay of Pigs invasion[3]. A crucial moment in the crisis arrived on October 24, when Soviet ships bound for Cuba neared the line of U.S. vessels enforcing the blockade, which could have sparked a military confrontation that could have quickly escalated to a nuclear exchange[2]. The tumultuous U.S.-Cuba relationship had its roots in the Cold War and was a result of the U.S. severing diplomatic ties with Cuba, pursuing covert operations to overthrow the Fidel Castro regime, and instituting a full economic embargo in 1961[3][4]. The Cuban missile crisis strengthened Kennedy\u2019s image domestically and internationally and may have helped mitigate negative world opinion regarding the failed Bay of Pigs invasion[5]. It also resulted in the establishment of a direct telephone link between the White House and the Kremlin, known as the \u201cHotline\u201d, and the beginnings of a nuclear Test Ban Treaty.[1][5]"}
{"answer": "Building a nanorobot typically involves using a nanorobotic manufacturing system such as \u03bcRobotex, which uses a robotically operated ion gun, housed in a large vacuum chamber, to shoot out a focusing ion beam (FIB)[1]. Additionally, one can build pixel nanobots by setting all the empty pixels to gray and then setting a one pixel at a random location to one of 16 basic colors with RGB code notation, which can create more than 65,000 individual nanobots[2]. Scientists have also programmed an autonomous molecular nanorobot made out of DNA to start, move, turn, and stop while following a DNA track[4]. Lastly, building pixel nanobots on a computer screen can be a helpful way of exploring the difference between autonomic and cognitive jobs before building a robot in the real world[5]."}
{"answer": "Rain is fresh and not salty because only water evaporates from the ocean, and the salt and other impurities are left behind in the ocean[2][4][5]. When the water vapor is lifted into the air, it cools, condenses and forms a cloud, and any rain that falls would be salt-free water[3]. The tiny parcels of salt can sometimes mix with the rain and cause it to become somewhat salty[2][4][5], but the salt does not evaporate with the water and so the rainwater remains fresh[2][4][5]."}
{"answer": "Most viral videos now have licensing info in the description box because various platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok require users to consent to similar license agreements before granting access to their platforms[3]. These licenses allow platforms to incorporate user content in their own advertisements for the platform company, and YouTube's Content ID audio detection system will occasionally display a copyright notice on videos using licensed AudioJungle music[4]. This ensures that the user has the rights to use the content they are posting, and also allows them to potentially profit from the exposure if their content is spotlighted in a commercial for the platform[5]."}
{"answer": "A MAC address (media access control address) is a 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to each device connected to the network[1][2][3][4][5]. It is a unique identifier assigned to a NIC (Network Interface Controller/ Card)[3][4] and is also referred to as a hardware or physical address[1][2][5]. The MAC address works on the OSI model's data link layer and is required when trying to locate a device or when performing diagnostics on a network device[4][5]. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), a layer 2 communication protocol, maps the MAC addresses to the IP (Internet Protocol) address[5]."}
{"answer": "Adept music players are able to start playing along to anything that someone else plays and have it sound good because of their experience and ear training. They are able to recognize patterns in the music, and latch onto them, allowing them to either duplicate what someone else is playing or take off and do a riff on the basic theme[3]. They also know the key the music is in, so they know that the music will start from the root and move around the major third and major fifth a lot, then come back to the root[4]. By knowing this, they can make educated guesses that will usually sound good. Lastly, they have put in the time to learn and master their instrument, so they are able to improvise and create music that never sounds the same twice[5]."}
{"answer": "If you ground up a piece of pure iron and ate it, your body would not absorb it the same way as iron from food. Iron from food is absorbed in the small intestine, specifically the duodenum, where it is exposed to stomach acid and changed into a form that allows it to be easily absorbed[1]. To make iron supplements absorbable, they contain different amounts of elemental iron[4], and non-heme iron is mainly found in plant foods and can be improved by eating foods containing vitamin C, vitamin A, along with meat, fish, and poultry during your meals[5]."}
{"answer": "The actual cause of the common itch is not always known, but it can be caused by an underlying medical condition, contact with an irritant or a reaction to a medication[4]. Scratching the itch is a way to provide relief from the uncomfortable sensation[3]. Scratching can temporarily relieve the itch, but it can also damage the skin and lead to more itching or even infection[1]."}
{"answer": "When you space out, your brain is essentially taking a mental break from the task at hand. It can be due to things like stress, fatigue, or drug misuse, and it may be a preservation tactic that your body taps into when it feels overwhelmed[2]. It can also be beneficial, as it allows your brain to process and think through important things and come up with creative solutions[3], or when you are mentally or emotionally consumed by something other than the task at hand[4]. In these moments, your brain can continue processing in the background[3][5]."}
{"answer": "A floating neutral is an electrical issue that occurs when the neutral connection opens due to a broken wire or other issue, which prevents electricity from flowing in its normal path. This poses serious risks to both people and properties, such as potential fire hazards, over- or under-voltage in appliances, and shocks to people who come into contact with the neutral wire[1]. It can also lead to high power bills and other damage to appliances, such as tools and lights[5]. It is important to contact an electrician as soon as possible to rectify the issue[2]."}
{"answer": "Childbirth is difficult and painful because of evolutionary trade-offs that ultimately help protect organs in the body[2]. The human pelvis changed in ways that made the birth canal narrower as humans developed an upright gait[1]. The pelvic floor and canal have balanced supporting internal organs while also facilitating childbirth, although this has made childbirth more difficult[3][5]. This is known as the \"obstetrical dilemma\"[4], as humans must find the balance between a narrow birth canal and protecting the organs.[1]"}
{"answer": "American TV shows are extremely popular around the world. In France, the top ten American exports involve some form of crime-solving, with Grey's Anatomy as the only non-crime show in the top ten[1]. In South Korea, ABC's Scandal is the most popular American show[1][2]. American TV shows can provide viewers with an insight into American core values, traditions and family life[3]. Furthermore, many international shows have been popular in the US over the years, with people watching a wide range of shows from cozy British mysteries to florid Asian soap operas[4]. However, in Japan, American shows are rare, while in Europe they are popular but politicians are trying to keep them from taking over the airwaves[5]."}
{"answer": "Service animals can help autistic children in a variety of ways. They can provide constant positive companionship, make difficult transitions easier, perform specific tasks, and reduce stress and anxiety[2]. They can also help to deflect emotions in negative situations, and help the child to focus on positive activities instead of their own distress[2]. Service animals are also trained to recognize and gently interrupt self-harming behaviors or help de-escalate an emotional meltdown[4]. Finally, they should be treated primarily as a tool that can be used to help the child with autism, and not as a family pet[5]."}
{"answer": "Books downloaded from the library need to be \"returned\" after a given amount of time because library books are automatically returned to the library on their due date. If the title is reserved, the book must be returned immediately if the guaranteed loan period has expired[5]. If you used other software to access your book, you may not be able to return it early but the item will be automatically returned at the end of the loan period[2]. If a book has not been returned on time or has been damaged, you are liable to pay a replacement fee and will be invoiced a flat-rate sum[4]."}
{"answer": "Stephen Hawking used a speech-generating device (SGD) or a voice output communication aid to talk through \u2018the computer\u2019[1][2]. This device either supplements or replaces speech/writing and was used by Hawking since 1997[1][2]. He had to replace the entire computer system every two years to cope with the gradual loss of control over his muscles over time[1]. To control the computer, Hawking used a thumb switch and a blink-switch attached to his glasses[1][3]. By squeezing his cheek muscles and \"blinking\" an infra-red switch, he was able to scan and select characters on the screen in order to compose speeches, surf the Internet, send e-mail and \"speak\" through a voice synthesizer[3]. Finally, to speak the complete sentence out loud, Hawking used a speech synthesizer (developed by Speech+) that spoke the sentence once it had been approved or completed[5]. It had an unmistakable accent, which had been diversely described as American, Scottish or Scandinavian[5]."}
{"answer": "Self-driving cars use a combination of sensor inputs, speed, and other information to calculate the most likely consequences of different trajectories and determine which course of action to take[2]. To make this decision, the car must consider the risk of fatality, the potential of the truck-driver to react and prevent the accident, and other factors[1][2][4]. As seen in the Uber accident of 2018, when self-driving cars fail to detect potential hazards or make incorrect decisions, the consequences can be fatal. As such, self-driving cars should not be given the right to choose their own accident-algorithms, as this would complicate coordination and compromise safety[5]."}
{"answer": "Eating spicy food can make you sweat because it contains a chemical called capsaicin which fools your brain into thinking your body temperature is rising[1][5], which triggers your body to sweat in order to cool you down[1][4]. In rare cases, it could be a sign of an underlying medical issue[3]."}
{"answer": "It is not possible to have an obese goalie in the NHL due to equipment regulations. The goalie needs to move quickly in order to protect the net, and an obese goalie would not be able to move fast enough. The goalie equipment rules are the same or more restrictive than in the past, and the size of the catcher and blocker is limited for all goalies[5]. Taller goalies can have larger pads, which block even more of the net[5]. Additionally, an obese goalie would not be able to see their shoes or properly follow the action behind them[4]."}
{"answer": "Computers can generate truly random numbers by observing some outside data, like mouse movements or fan noise, which is not predictable, and creating data from it (known as entropy)[2]. They can also generate \u201cpseudorandom\u201d numbers by using an algorithm so the results appear random, even though they aren\u2019t[2]. To generate true, uncrackable randomness, computers need to do something very strange indeed, such as asking the world for help[4]. They can also use mathematical operations and variables (like the time of day and a stock market price) to produce a third number that is hard to predict[4]. These numbers are random enough for most applications, but if used repeatedly, careful analysis will always reveal some underlying pattern[4]."}
{"answer": "There are several possible explanations for why gas prices do not come down as fast as when the price of oil increases. One is that gas station owners worry that when the wholesale price of gas they pay drops, there is no assurance the price won\u2019t again rise, so they wait until they see a trend in oil prices[1]. Another explanation is that when oil prices rapidly increase, the full increase is not always passed on to consumers[5]. Research has also found that gas prices fall twice as slowly as they rise after a major change in oil prices[4], so it may take several weeks for gas prices to catch up with oil prices. Additionally, the current unrest with the Russia Ukraine conflict could affect the price of oil and gas prices[5]."}
{"answer": "A linear induction motor (LIM) is an alternating current (AC), asynchronous linear motor that works by the same general principles as other induction motors[2]. It operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction[3], and is comprised of two parts, the primary and secondary, which interact with one another only when power is applied[4]. It is similar in construction to a circular motor that has been opened out flat, and the magnetic field now sweeps across the flat motor face instead of rotating[1]. Unlike a circular induction motor, a linear induction motor shows 'end effects'[2][5], which include losses in performance and efficiency that are believed to be caused by magnetic energy being carried away and lost at the end of the primary by the relative movement of the primary and secondary.[5]"}
{"answer": "The point of money is to provide people with security, freedom, or opportunity[1], to help make decisions and provide insight into what you can do to align with your values[2], to facilitate transactions and power financial growth[4], and to serve as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value[5]."}
{"answer": "Charge builds up in a cloud due to the friction of colliding droplets of water and ice, as well as freezing[2]. The friction of colliding droplets of water and ice knocks off electrons, leaving the rising water droplets positively charged, while the electrons gather near the bottom of the cloud, producing a negative charge. As water droplets rise, they encounter colder air temperatures and start to freeze, with the frozen portion of the droplet tending to acquire a negative charge, and the unfrozen portion tending to acquire a positive charge[2]. As the static charge buildup in the storm cloud increases, the electric field surrounding the cloud becomes stronger and can ionize the surrounding air and make it more conductive, allowing for charge transfer from the cloud to the ground or to other clouds[5]."}
{"answer": "Sea turtles are able to find their way back to their natal areas, even if they are located on islands, through a combination of geomagnetic imprinting and magnetic navigation[2]. Studies have shown that juvenile turtles are able to use magnetic navigation to move towards distant goals[3], and that they are able to create a \"magnetic map\" of their natal area to use for navigation[2][3][5]. This suggests that, even if a hypothetical turtle was placed on a remote island in the sun, it would be able to use a combination of magnetic imprinting and navigation to find its way back home.[1]"}
{"answer": "A home equity loan is a type of loan that lets you borrow a lump sum of money by tapping the equity in your home while using your home as collateral to secure the loan[1][2][3]. It is calculated as the difference between your home\u2019s market value and the remaining balance on your mortgage[1], and you can borrow up to a certain percentage of your equity, depending on your lender's requirements[1]. You will receive a lump-sum payment and will repay the loan with fixed-rate interest over a predetermined term[5]."}
{"answer": "The rule for the use of \u201can\u201d or \u201ca\u201d is that you use \u201ca\u201d before words that start with a consonant sound and \u201can\u201d before words that start with a vowel sound[1][2][4]. This rule applies regardless of spelling[2], and is essential when deciding which article to place before \u201cone\u201d[1]. Additionally, we also use \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d to refer to a single one when there is more than one[5]."}
{"answer": "We have two small nostrils instead of one larger nostril for several reasons. Firstly, having two nostrils gives us stereoscopic smell, which means we can detect more scents and smells than if we just had one nostril. Secondly, two nostrils offer less resistance to airflow than a single large nostril, which helps us filter and condition the air we breathe[2]. Thirdly, we have something called the nasal cycle, where we predominantly breathe through one nostril at a time, and the other side becomes congested and rests[3]. Fourthly, the nostrils are separated by the septum, which can sometimes be deviated, causing one nostril to appear larger than the other[1][4]. And finally, the airflow between both nostrils is not always equal, with one nostril allowing more air to pass through than the other[1][2][5]."}
{"answer": "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet[1][2][5]. It is used to Exchange routing information for the internet and is the protocol used between ISP which are different ASes[3][5]. It is classified as a path-vector routing protocol and makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator[2]. BGP is the routing method that enables the Internet to function[1][3][4][5], and it manages how packets get routed from network to network through the exchange of routing and reachability information among edge routers[5]."}
{"answer": "Street harassment is not a compliment because it is an aggressive and unwanted sexual advance that makes the woman feel powerless and objectified[1]. It makes women feel vulnerable and weak[4], and many women are too shocked to respond[2]. Street harassment is not the same as giving a friendly greeting or a genuine compliment[2][4], and it is not a harmless bit of fun[2]. It has a real and enormous impact on victims' lives[2]."}
{"answer": "Fake meat is often made from plant proteins such as soy, wheat gluten, and tofu[2][4]. The texture of fake meat is achieved by breaking down the proteins and reshaping them with a food extruder or by using wet extrusion processes[4]. Lastly, food manufacturers season the faux meat to mimic the flavors and textures of real meat[3]."}
{"answer": "The body does not produce oil like the face does because it is a waste of resources. The body has to spend more resources to produce the oil again, resulting in a lesser quality oil that is more prone to oxidation[2]. Also, when oil is removed from the skin, the same amount of oil is produced, but it ends up in the wrong place[3]. To prevent this, it is important to induce a production of a more viscous oil by lowering triglycerides and increasing unsaturated fatty acid content[4]. However, this does not mean you should stop using face oil, as it is still beneficial[5]."}
{"answer": "The use of dash cameras in Asia has increased significantly, particularly in China, which has surpassed the US as the largest automotive market in the world[1][2]. This number is expected to continue to grow as more automobiles are produced, and rapid growth is occurring in other countries as well[1][2]. While there are no regulations on installing a dash cam in Asia, in Korea, it is known that a dash cam is a compulsory accessory to equip one when buying a new car[4]. In Korea, where the concept has originally started, users have seen the benefits of installing a dash cam[3][5]."}
{"answer": "Second day chili is better because it allows the flavors to meld together and become more harmonious[1][4], and the harsh flavors mellow out[1]. Also, the chili can develop a thicker and more sumptuous texture[5], making it even more enjoyable to eat. Furthermore, any leftovers from the first day will taste even better the next day[2]. Finally, the extra time in the fridge gives the flavor a chance to soak into the meat[5], resulting in a tastier dish."}
{"answer": "The cost of a Tv Pc Screen varies depending on the different parameters, such as display technology, display modes, viewing angle, etc[2]. Large computer monitors usually cost above Rs 25,000[2]. Large computer monitors are usually found above a screen size of 30 inches[3], while the most popular screen size for TV is 32-inches and 43-inches[4][5]. For monitors, the standard size ranges from 18-inches to 32-inches for the standard aspect ratio, and up to 50-inches for ultra-wide monitors[5]."}
{"answer": "No, if you have no sense of taste, you cannot feel the heat or spiciness from something like a pepper. The heat or spiciness from the pepper is not a taste, but rather a neurological response caused by the pepper's membrane releasing capsaicin, a chemical compound that clamps onto your mouth's neurotransmitters, which regulate temperature[1]. This false alert your brain interprets as a blast of heat, without damaging any tissue or taste buds[1]."}
{"answer": "Turboprop airplanes are able to stay balanced without the use of a tail rotor because they use trim controls to adjust the ailerons on the plane in the opposite direction slightly, which counters the torque applied by the propeller[2]. This is different from helicopters, which use tail rotors to stop spinning in the opposite direction as the main rotor due to torque reaction[2]. Coaxial helicopters, or those with one individual rotor, also use a gyroscopic controller to help balance out the single rotor with the tail[3]."}
{"answer": "The main difference between an air-conditioner and a marine air conditioner is that the marine AC system uses water to cool air, unlike a home AC system that uses air only[1][4][5]. Marine air conditioners are also typically self-contained and have access to an unlimited supply of water[4], whereas home AC systems use the air outside of the home to heat exchange[1][4][5]. Marine air conditioners also discharge their water overboard, whereas a home AC system does not[1][4][5]."}
{"answer": "Adding an amendment to the Constitution to award DC the same status of a state would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by 38 states, which has not been achieved[1]. Additionally, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 established a process known as \"preclearance\", which requires jurisdictions to demonstrate that any proposed change in voting does not deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group[3]. This extra layer of protection makes it difficult for the District of Columbia to get the same voting rights as the 50 U.S. states."}
{"answer": "The printing press was invented in China by Wang Chen in the 11th century, but it did not appear in Europe until 150 years later due to the lack of access to the technology[5]. Johannes Gutenberg was a political exile from Mainz, Germany when he began experimenting with printing in Strasbourg, France in 1440[5]. It took him several years to perfect his invention, the Gutenberg press, which was ready to use commercially in 1450[5]. The Printing Revolution that the press started allowed for the mass production of uniform printed matter, which drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents in Europe[2][4]."}
{"answer": "While it is currently highly unlikely for two people to have matching finger/thumbprints, fingerprint technology offers extremely high accuracy[3], and modern fingerprint recognition systems are highly accurate[2]. However, optical scanners are the easiest to trick[1], and false negatives (inability to recognize a legitimate user) may still occur if proper scanning doesn\u2019t take place[3]. Additionally, there have been cases where people have been falsely convicted on the basis of fingerprint matching. Therefore, while it may be possible in the future to have matching finger/thumbprints, it is currently highly unlikely."}
{"answer": "A military can overthrow a government by executing a coup. Different typologies of coups have been offered by scholars, such as palace revolutions, reform coups, and veto coups[1][2]. In order to prevent a coup, rulers often adopt coup-proofing strategies such as artificially inflating defense budgets, keeping the size of the military small, or counterbalancing the military with republican guards, militarized police, and other paramilitary forces[3][4]. In the case of Mali, the junta has overthrown the government and is attempting to establish a government that the international community can accept[5]."}
{"answer": "Binary code is a system that represents numbers, text, and other information in binary digits[4]. Computers use binary code to process and store information since the physical states of a computer's transistors can be either on or off[4]. When a programmer writes code and programs for a computer, they are not dealing with binary numbers directly. Instead, they use a programming language that helps them get the job done more easily and quickly[3]. Programming languages include a compiler, which is a tool that translates a programmer's work into the 0s and 1s that the machines need[1][4]. This binary code is then used by the computer to interpret and run the programmer's programs[4]."}
{"answer": "Spicy food can stay spicy when it comes out the other end because the TRPV1 pain receptors in the anus are activated when the spicy food passes through it. Additionally, it is possible that we have trained ourselves to like spicy food due to the endorphins and psychological pleasure associated with it[2], or because of the health benefits associated with it[2]. Spicy foods usually contain a compound called capsaicin, which is what causes the burning or irritation sensation when it touches the tongue[4]. To become more tolerant of spicy food, people should introduce small amounts of it into their diet over time[5]."}
{"answer": "When you light a lighter in front of a TV, you can see four tiny rainbows around the flame due to the diffraction of light. This is caused by the fine lines etched into the plastic of the TV, which reflects light at different angles and produces interference between the colors of the light[3]. When light interference occurs, one color of light is cancelled out, leaving only the other colors visible in the form of a rainbow pattern[3][4]."}
{"answer": "It is important to provide attribution for the source of a work when using references in order to respect the moral and economic rights of the creator. Most of the time, simply providing an in-text citation and reference list entry is enough to credit the work of another author[2]. However, in some cases, such as the use of certain types of works, a copyright attribution is required[2][4]. Plagiarism can easily be avoided by referencing correctly[3]. Therefore, it is important to consider whether you have a right to use a work under copyright law and to always provide attribution for the source of a work[5]."}
{"answer": "China claims Taiwan as part of its own territory and has done so since 1949[4]. China exerts considerable diplomatic pressure on other countries not to recognise Taiwan, or to do anything which implies recognition[3]. Taiwan has been living under the constant threat of an invasion by China for decades[4]. Beijing has intensified its claim over Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen was first elected president in Taiwan in 2016, claiming she is a \u201cseparatist\u201d and refusing to engage with her[5]. Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to pursue peaceful reunification between China and Taiwan and has seen a major increase in Chinese defence spending[2]."}
{"answer": "The word 'cunt' is considered a taboo word in the U.S. for a variety of reasons. It is associated with misogyny and has been used to degrade women[1][3], and it could be argued that the meaning behind the word has contributed towards its notoriety[3]. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission has added it to their list of 'seven dirty words', which has likely contributed to its taboo status[4]. Finally, it is considered very offensive due to its strong misogynistic overtone[5]."}
{"answer": "The human voice is produced by a process called vocalization, which involves the movement of air through the vocal folds (vocal cords) in the larynx[5]. The uniqueness of the human voice lies in our ability to precisely coordinate the physical movements and to process the sounds into meaningful language[1]. While we don't know whether we have evolved to have unique voices, it is likely that based on differences in anatomy and how we use our voice, that we all sound different to each other[2][3]. Luckily, computer algorithms are still able to make the most of the individuality of the human voice by creating \u201cvoice prints\u201d based on mathematical solutions which pick up the specific acoustic features of each individual voice[4]."}
{"answer": "AK47s are not an \"accurate\" rifle because they are not as accurate as weapons used by the US military like the M4 at distances outside of 200 yards[3]. The AK also doesn't have the same precision or accuracy as other more expensive rifles. Real life accuracy values, which can be found in the SDK files, are accurate in this instance and confirm that AKs are not inherently accurate rifles[4][5]."}
{"answer": "It is common to not remember what happened when you are drunk because alcohol can interfere with the process of memories being consolidated into long-term memory[5]. This usually happens when a person has had five or more drinks[2]. Alcohol can also prevent your brain from encoding what you\u2019re seeing and doing, so you can\u2019t retrieve those memories later when you\u2019re sober[5]. This can lead to having gaps in your memory from drinking, or \u2018black outs\u2019[5]."}
{"answer": "There is a difference between the global water cycle and the human-usable portion of the water cycle. The global water cycle involves all of the water on the earth, including salty oceans and lakes, locked up as ice, or in the atmosphere, while the human-usable portion is limited to fresh liquid water on or near the surface of the earth[3][4]. We are not necessarily \"losing\" freshwater, but rather, we are simply using the limited supply we have at a greater rate than nature replenishes it[2]. Wasting water does not directly hurt the global environment, since the water is not destroyed. Rather, wasting water hurts humans, as it leaves them with less accessible, usable water[3]. Additionally, wasting too much water can hurt the local environment as it drains too much usable water away from the natural ecosystem[3]."}
{"answer": "The Insane Clown Posse has grown a large cult following of loyal fans, called Juggalos, due to their horrorcore hip-hop music and the sense of family and acceptance that comes with it[1]. This past weekend, Juggalos gathered in Washington, D.C. to protest the FBI who has refused to rescind the \"gang\" classification that was placed on them by the government in 2011[4]. The Juggalos have embraced their poverty and accept anyone into their family, regardless of class or gender[5], which has made them a tight-knit community and created a sense of solidarity and loyalty to the music of Insane Clown Posse."}
{"answer": "The best way for a relatively skinny but unhealthy guy to get big using weights (with or without protein powder) is to use quality supplements like N-Large2 Mass Gainer and BCAA Plus, and to consume high-quality proteins and energy-fueling carbohydrates. It is also important to consume a low-fat, low-carb protein powder such as Bulk Pure Whey Isolate 90, which has 27g of protein in every 30g serving[5]. Additionally, it is important to work out regularly in order to gain lean, clean muscle[3]."}
{"answer": "Swear words related to genitals and/or sexuality are considered offensive in many cultures because they come from things that are taboo or distasteful. This is likely because male sexuality has usually been considered acceptable but female sexuality is less commonly accepted and expressed[3]. Historical evidence suggests that this is because people had little privacy and their sense of shame was less developed than modern people[5]. Additionally, racist, sexist, and fatist terms have become more taboo in modern times[4]."}
{"answer": "Birds typically know not to sit on their unfertilized eggs because they can tell the difference between fertilized and unfertilized eggs externally. Unfertilized eggs do not develop and the bird may become stressed from sitting on them for extended periods of time[2]. Fertilization occurs internally before the egg is laid, as the cells of the ovum are dividing[3]. If the bird clutches and sits on the eggs, they should be left in[3][4], as the shape, color, size and frequency of laying varies between different bird species[5]."}
{"answer": "Implementing a substantial basic income has been argued to reduce \"werkgelegenheid\" (employment) in order to improve labour market flexibility, boost low wage employment and part-time work[1]. This is because workers may not find jobs that suit their skills due to the lack of work experience and/or difficulties signaling their skills, which may cause their reservation wages to be higher than wage offers they receive[2]. Additionally, research has found that payroll subsidies for manual workers, such as the Finnish payroll subsidy for older, low-wage workers, can reduce hours of work and hourly earnings[3]. Other studies have also found that increases in the minimum wage reduce employment, but found no evidence of increased employment when the payroll tax subsidy was increased[4]. Finally, there is evidence that the employment effects of wage subsidies persist long after the subsidy expires, as it increases workers' lifetime earnings[4][5]. \"Job opportunities\" is a different metric, which refers to the percentage of people who are actively seeking a job who are able to find one."}
{"answer": "The Venezuelan legislative elections in December of 2020 resulted in a major victory for the opposition Movement for Democratic Unity (MUD), with 107 seats to the ruling party's 55 seats[2]. The National Electoral Council (CNE) also awarded victory to the ruling Socialist party in 20 governorships and three to opposition politicians[3]. The presidential election in May 2018 had a turnout of 32 percent[5], but the winner, incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, declared it a knockout, claiming that the 68 percent of the vote he received was the highest percentage for a winner in a Venezuelan presidential election[5]. Several countries, including the European Union, the Organization of American States, the Lima Group and countries including Australia and the United States, rejected the electoral process due to irregularities, such as the lack of the Constituent Assembly's competencies to summon the elections and the lack of time for standard electoral functions[1]. However, other countries, such as China, Cuba, Iran, Russia, Syria, and Turkey, recognized the election result.[1]"}
{"answer": "The G-spot is located a few centimeters along the inner front wall of the vagina, between the vaginal opening and the urethra, about two inches in and one inch up inside of the vagina[1][2][5]. It is a sensitive area that may be part of the female prostate, has a ridged texture to it and responds to gentle stroking[2][5]. However, it varies from person to person and other factors may play a role in whether or not a female can find the G-spot or identify a specific spot as their G-spot[4]."}
{"answer": "Putting metal in the microwave can be dangerous because the microwaves can cause the electrons in the metal to become energized and create sparks that can damage the internal circuitry of the microwave[1][5]. Additionally, the metal can reflect the microwaves back to the magnetron, which can damage it, rendering your microwave useless[1][3]. There is metal in the microwave already, such as the walls and circuitry, and the door has a mesh built in that helps to shield and contain the microwaves[3][5]. When using metal in the microwave, it is important to make sure that the metal is not pointed, has no sharp corners, and is not too thin, in order to prevent sparking[3][5]. Additionally, some metals, such as aluminum, are designed to absorb the microwaves and heat up, such as the pouch on a Hot Pocket[4]."}
{"answer": "Traffic lights use detectors to detect when a car arrives at an intersection. The most common technique is the inductive loop, which is embedded in the road's surface and detects when a car has arrived by detecting a change of inductance[1][4]. Detectors can also detect when too many cars are stacked up at an intersection, which controls the duration of the light[2][4]. Some intersections also have cameras which can detect the presence of cars waiting and signal the lights to begin changing[3]. For large cities, the traffic lights may simply operate on timers with no detectors[2][4]."}
{"answer": "The size of the universe is vast and estimated to be around 28 billion light years across[1][4][5]. It has been expanding for almost 13.8 billion years at a fraction of the speed of light[1][5], so the true size may be even larger, estimated to be about 7 trillion light-years in diameter[3]."}
{"answer": "School hours and corporate working hours do not match because there is at least a two-hour gap between the two and there is no official acknowledgement of this issue[1]. This is a real crisis for families with both working parents that is being overlooked[2][5]. Some have suggested reducing the workday for all staff (without reducing salaries) and making more accommodations over the school holiday periods[4], while others have pointed out that the societal mismatch between work being \u20189 to 5\u2019 and school being less than that is creating a stressful situation for working parents[5]."}
{"answer": "The Warsaw Uprising was an armed insurrection during the Second World War organized by the Polish underground resistance, or Home Army (AK), which had been fighting against the Nazi occupation since the invasion of Poland in September 1939[1]. The uprising started on August 1, 1944 and lasted until October 2, 1944[3][4]. The impetus for the military action was the ongoing retreat of the German forces from Poland and the appearance of the Soviet Red Army along the east bank of the Vistula River[4]. The majority of participants in the uprising were members of the Gray Ranks (Szare Szeregi), an underground paramilitary wing of the Polish Scouting Association (Zwiazek Harcestwa Polskiego or ZHP)[5]."}
{"answer": "The primary difference between natural selection and genetic drift is that natural selection is a process where more adaptive species are selected in response to environmental challenges, while genetic drift is a random selection[1][4]. Natural selection is usually driven as a response to an organism's environmental challenges[1][3], while genetic drift is completely random and based on luck[3][4]. Natural selection is not random and represents only positive change/adaptation[4], while genetic drift can have helpful, detrimental, or no effect. Natural selection is influenced by changes in environmental conditions[4], while genetic drift is random and based on luck[3][4]. Lastly, gene flow helps keep alleles in a population homogenized[4], while natural selection increases genetic variation and always moves towards creating new species[4]."}
{"answer": "Professional athletes have a significantly lower pulse than the average person because exercise strengthens the heart muscle, enabling it to pump a greater volume of blood with each heartbeat. This means that more oxygen gets delivered to the muscles, so the heart needs to beat fewer times than it would in a less-fit person while at rest[4]. It is also thought to be due to intrinsic changes within the heart, such as the down-regulation of the HCN4 gene[5]. However, a low resting heart rate should not be taken lightly and may be accompanied by dizziness, fainting, or illness, in which case you should consult a medical professional[1]."}
{"answer": "The Pirate Bay Megathread is a thread on the /r/Piracy subreddit where users can find links and information related to piracy. It includes links to torrent sites, direct download sites, trainers (cheats), repacks, release networks, ROM sites, emulators, torrent software, direct downloading software, tools, useful software, useful browser extensions, VPNs, unsafe software, untrusted sites/uploaders[4]. The megathread is no longer maintained and users are cautioned to use it at their own risk[2]. However, it is regularly updated with new links or periodically reviewed when necessary[5]. Users who have critiques or suggestions for the megathread or would like to be granted contribution privileges can send a mod mail to the subreddit[1]."}
{"answer": "Landlords make money from rental properties in several ways. First, they collect rent from tenants, and what's left in the pot after covering expenses gives them an income[1]. Second, landlords bank on the rental property appreciating in long-term value and cash out the equity when they sell or refinance[1]. Third, they look at the capitalization rate, which is the ratio between the property's net income and the value of the property[4]. Fourth, they often pay a portion of the house price upfront, and use the rental income to pay off the loan and cover other expenses on the house, leaving some cash leftover[5]."}
{"answer": "The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone has had a mostly positive overall impact on the ecosystem, including on both small and large species, as well as on plant life[2]. Wolves have impacted the ecosystem by changing the feeding habits of elk, which has likely contributed to the rebound of the beaver population in the area[3]. However, it is difficult to accurately measure the full extent of the wolves' impact due to the complexity of nature and the limited funding for long-term research[4]."}
{"answer": "The main difference between a CEO and the President of a company is the level of hierarchy[1][3][4]. The CEO is the highest-ranking officer in the company and outranks the president[1][2][3][4][5]. The CEO is typically responsible for deciding and pursuing the company mission, vision, and strategy, as well as maintaining the financial success of the business[4], while the president is responsible for strategy and operations management[4]. In smaller companies, the roles of CEO and president are usually conducted by the same person[3][5], while in larger corporations they are usually held by different people."}
{"answer": "Grounding is important in order to prevent electric shock. Grounding provides a safe path for stray voltage to follow, directing it into the ground where it can be discharged safely instead of building up in places where it can be dangerous[5]. It is also important for electric workers to stay on top of changes in grounding principles in order to protect against electric shock[2]. While grounding does cause immediate operation of a circuit protective device, it is actually bonding that protects an individual from injury[3]."}
{"answer": "People usually get the plague through the bite of fleas that have previously fed on infected animals like mice, rats, rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks, and prairie dogs[1]. It can also be spread through direct contact with a person or animal that has the infection or by eating an infected animal[1]. Contact with contaminated fluid or tissue of a plague-infected animal can also cause infection[1][2][3]. The plague bacteria, Y. pestis, can infect the lymph nodes (bubonic plague), cause damage to organs (septicemic plague), or cause severe inflammation and respiratory failure (pneumonic plague)[4]. Bubonic plague is usually contracted from flea bites, but it can move into the blood and cause septicemic plague[5]. Pneumonic plague is uncommon but can spread from person to person.[5]"}
{"answer": "It is possible for a person to have bruised lungs without broken ribs. A bruise is treated like a fracture in most cases, but it is still a good idea to take an x-ray to rule out complications such as splintering or severe fracture of the rib, as well as to check for any damage done to the lung[3]. A doctor will diagnose a bruised rib by reviewing symptoms and conducting a physical exam, as well as listening to and watching the patient's chest while they breathe to see if any lung function may have been affected[5]. If the rib is fractured, the pointy ends of the bone could cause injury to the lung[3][4]."}
{"answer": "When dentists scrape at your teeth with those metal picks, they are removing plaque and tartar buildup[2]. They use specially shaped curettes and hand scalers to clean your tooth enamel of any tartar buildup, plaque, or localized stain[5]. They may also use a slow speed drill with a very soft rubber cup filled with a special tooth polishing paste called Prophylaxis paste (or prophy for short)[4]."}
{"answer": "A real number is a number that can take any value on the number line, and includes any of the rational and irrational numbers[1][2][3]. An imaginary number is a number that, when squared, has a negative result, and is not a real number as it cannot be quantified on the number line[1][2][3]. Complex numbers are a combination of real and imaginary numbers, and can be written as the sum or difference of a real number and an imaginary number[1][2][3][4]. All real numbers are also complex numbers with zero for the imaginary part, whereas all imaginary numbers are also complex numbers with zero for the real part[5]."}
{"answer": "Jeopardy contestants study for the show in different ways. They may use a study guide to help them memorize the answers and improve their performance, watch every episode of the show, make flashcards of trivia, and study the J-Archive database, which contains prior clues, time the buzzer, practice different types of questions, and watch previous episodes[2]. They may also have a natural ability to learn and remember information[5]."}
{"answer": "The WikiLeaks and Julian Assange debacle began in 2010 when Assange and WikiLeaks published a US military document containing a plan to \"destroy the center of gravity\" of WikiLeaks by attacking its trustworthiness[3]. This led to criticism from the Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, who condemned the original theft of the material[2]. This was followed by a revolt within her party and accusations of Assange by Nick Davies[2]. Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the German spokesman for WikiLeaks, resigned in September 2010, citing a structural problem within the organisation and dissatisfaction with Assange's management[4]. Domscheit-Berg left with a small group to start OpenLeaks, a new leak organisation and website with a different management and distribution philosophy[4]. In February 2011, Domscheit-Berg released a tell-all book about his experience with Assange and WikiLeaks[4]."}
{"answer": "Homeopathy is a 200-year-old form of alternative medicine that claims to stimulate a healing response and strengthen the body\u2019s ability to heal itself[1]. It is based on the idea that if a substance causes symptoms in a healthy person, tiny doses of that substance can treat the symptoms in someone who is unwell[2]. Homeopathy is a medical system that was developed in Germany more than 200 years ago and it is based on two unconventional theories[4]. It was developed by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann and it believes that using extremely minute diluted amounts of plants and minerals can help the body repair itself by promoting healing[5]."}
{"answer": "A high protein, low carb diet is generally considered to be beneficial for weight loss and for preserving or increasing muscle mass[5]. It may also help to lower blood sugar, insulin, bad cholesterol, and blood pressure[1] and boost HDL (\"good\") cholesterol[1]. Additionally, it may improve blood sugar control, lower your risk of heart disease, and enhance bone health[2]."}
{"answer": "Computer telephone response systems ask for a bunch of info, then transfer the caller to a human who asks for the exact same info in order to reduce friction for customers and provide more efficient and robust self-service tools. This is done by using Interactive Voice Response (IVR), which enables the automated telephony system to have basic interactions with callers[1], and Natural Language Processing (NLP), which allows the IVR to understand and respond to more than just single words[4]. Additionally, the IVR system can also ask for the caller\u2019s number for a scheduled callback if there are no available agents to answer the call[3]."}
{"answer": "Lakes and ponds around the world tend to have fairly similar fish because they generally have similar environmental characteristics, such as temperature, pH levels, and the presence of certain nutrients that are suitable for the fish. The environment of the lake also affects the type of fish that can survive in the habitat, as different species of fish have different needs and requirements for survival[1]. Additionally, lakes provide important habitats for a variety of organisms, including fish, and are a vital part of local ecosystems[5]."}
{"answer": "Bars and clubs typically charge a cover charge, which is often used to cover the costs of hiring performers[1][2][3][4], or to gain additional revenue from customers if there is an excess demand[3]. They may also have a \"no cover\" policy, which is used to draw and retain customers, who will then buy drinks[2]. Some bars and clubs also allow bands or performers to provide a list of guests who can enter without paying the cover charge[1][4]. Bouncers may also waive the cover charge for regular customers or friends, though this can be illegal in some cases[4]. Some bars may also raise the prices of drinks to make up for the lack of a cover charge[1][3][4]."}
{"answer": "Operator overloading is a compile-time polymorphism in which the operator is overloaded to provide a special meaning to the user-defined data type[2]. It is used to perform the operation on the user-defined data type, such as adding the variables of the user-defined data type to the built-in data types[2]. Operator overloading is generally defined by a programming language, a programmer, or both[1][5]."}
{"answer": "Vanity sizing is the practice of assigning smaller sizes to articles of manufactured clothing than is really the case, in order to encourage sales[1][2]. This practice has been documented primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom[3]. Vanity sizing can boost self-esteem, but it can also make it difficult for one to know their actual measurements, and can make one overlook the importance of leading a healthy lifestyle and maintaining appropriate body weight[4]. Vanity sizing has been linked to body image confidence and self-esteem in women."}
{"answer": "Group mentality is powerful because it is part of human nature and people feel heard when they are part of a group[1]. Studies have also found that people have an ingroup bias, where they have favoritism for a group, even if they have no vested interest in it[2]. In addition, mob mentality is often an unconscious process where 95% of individuals follow the 5% who are leading the group[3]. People also conform to the group in their everyday life in order to make decision-making easier and avoid standing out[4]. Finally, being part of a group may make individuals feel more powerful by association."}
{"answer": "After a workout, our body goes into recovery mode and begins to readjust to its newfound status. Blood is pumped into the muscles that are worked out and oxygen levels increase, then when the workout is done, the body works to return to homeostasis and balance[2]. The body adapts to fitness and grows stronger as a result, but it is also kind of shocked at what just took place, so it has to work hard to return to its normal state and recover from the strain it was put under[4]."}
{"answer": "In 2010, Dane Cook's half-brother was convicted of embezzling millions of dollars from him while acting as his personal manager[2]. This may have contributed to his career stalling out, and he has since entered a new chapter in his life, one that is marginally less harmful if swallowed[3]. He has not developed a sense of humor about the time his brother ripped him off[4]. In the last few years, he has released a few specials and had a lead role in a straight to DVD crime thriller, but has otherwise been out of the public eye[5]."}
{"answer": "Unfortunately, there is no way to replicate the \"visual effect\" of the 70mm Ultra Panavision format used in The Hateful Eight in every theatre[2][4]. This format is associated with epic spectacle, and the resolution is equivalent to 18k, with the screen filling your entire field of view[2][5]. As such, the visual effect of watching the movie in this format cannot be replicated in any other format."}
{"answer": "Calvinism is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice set down by John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians[1][2]. It emphasizes the sovereignty of God and the authority of the Bible and is associated with the five principles of Calvinism, as formulated by the Synod of Dort[1][3][4]. As a theological system, Calvinism presents a comprehensive view of how human life should be properly ordered according to the sovereign will of God[4]. It is based on the belief that God\u2019s glory is the goal of all things, and that his freedom and his sovereignty are essential to his deity[5]."}
{"answer": "Analog watches feature a so-called date-wheels[3], which means that every month, the watch goes from 1 to 31, regardless if the month has 29 or 30 days. This means that if the month has 30 days, the watch will show \u201d31\u201d on the 1st and thereby needs to be reset to the correct date again[3]. For a digital watch, it\u2019s easy to keep track of the date because it knows what year it is and it knows exactly how many days each month has[4]. A perpetual calendar watch knows the date by being programmed to know exactly how many days each month has[4][5], and therefore, it never needs to be manually corrected. It takes into account leap years, the 28-days in February, as well as distinguishes the months with 30 and 31 days.[5]"}
{"answer": "The trick works by desensitizing the cone cells in the retina at the back of the eye[2][3][4]. Afterimages occur when the photoreceptors in our eyes are overstimulated and become fatigued[4]. When you stare at a stimulus for a prolonged period of time, your cones become desensitized to colors and send a weaker signal[1][4]. When the image switches to black and white, the opposite photoreceptor \u2013 red in this example \u2013 is still firing strong signals. The lack of green tricks your brain into thinking you are seeing red, when you aren't[5]."}
{"answer": "The use of the number 60 began with the Sumerians who used different number systems, such as base 12 and base 60. It is believed that they chose these systems because 60 is a superior highly composite number with twelve factors and is the lowest common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6[5]. This makes it easier to divide into sections, as one hour can be divided evenly into sections of 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 12 minutes, 10 minutes, 6 minutes, 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute[5]."}
{"answer": "The primary difference between i5 and i7 processors is the performance, with i7 processors being faster and having more cache (onboard memory) to help them deal with repetitive tasks[2][4]. The processor with the higher model number is considered faster[4], but this is not always the case as the i5-6600K is faster than the i7-6700, though it has less cache[4]. Additionally, the i5 and i7 have different architectures for laptops and desktops, meaning they cannot be interchanged[5], and the i7 processor is generally more expensive than the i5[2][4]."}
{"answer": "Fuel stabilizer works to stop the oxidation and chemical breakdown of gasoline by acting as an antioxidant and absorbing water before the fuel can do the same[3]. It also protects against varnish and gum formation, as well as fuel-system corrosion[4]. To get the best results, it is recommended to pour the fuel stabilizer into the tank and run the engine for a few minutes to distribute it through the system[3], and to opt for an ethanol-free type of gas[2][5]."}
{"answer": "The speedometer of a car measures the instantaneous speed of the vehicle and displays that data to the driver through the dashboard of the vehicle[1][2][3]. It works by gauging how quickly the wheels are spinning and then using electromagnetism to convert the spinning wheel energy into a smooth drifting motion in the gauge[4]. The speedometer is part of the instrument cluster which also displays other important vehicle statistics such as miles traveled, temperature of the vehicle, and fuel levels[5]."}
{"answer": "It would be very difficult to drill a hole to the center of the Earth because the immense pressure at depth would cause the sides of the hole to collapse and the interior of the Earth is very hot[1]. Even if we assume the hole is wide and perfectly straight and strong enough to keep it from collapsing or melting, it is unknown what would happen if someone fell into the hole[3]. There could be a crystallized structure between the core and the surface that is impossible to dig through by conventional means[4]. Newton's laws of mechanics and gravitation cannot be used to relate motion through the hole to the motion of a weight attached to a spring[5]."}
{"answer": "It is possible that you are not drinking your whiskey in the optimal way for your taste buds. If you find that you don't like your whiskey neat, try adding a little water[2], or try the whiskey neat before adding ice[2][3]. You could also try whiskey in a classic cocktail[4], as the assertiveness of rye whiskey bases can help enhance the flavors. The quality of the water you use can also affect the taste of your whiskey."}
{"answer": "Our peripheral vision is weaker than in many other species, and this disparity is even greater where it concerns our ability to distinguish color and shape[3]. This is due to the density of the receptor cells on the retina[3]. Also, our peripheral vision is poor even in young people with normal vision[5], and our peripheral vision is quick at detecting that something enters our field of sight but it is weak at distinguishing color, shape or detail[2]. Even when told to look for a world gone gray, the students didn\u2019t notice until about two-thirds of the color was gone[4], which suggests that our peripheral vision is not able to distinguish color very well.[5]"}
{"answer": "When you drink a glass of liquid, your body is trying to get rid of the excess liquid, so it will urinate twice as much as you drank[2]. Additionally, drinks with caffeine or alcohol can also cause you to urinate more frequently[3]. To limit the amount of times you urinate, it's best to drink most of your liquids during the waking hours, and limit your intake two to three hours before bedtime[4]. If you are still peeing too often despite this, it could be a sign that you are drinking more water than you need to[5]."}
{"answer": "Child support is typically based on income rather than what a child would need monthly because it is more practical and easier to track. If a parent does not have a source of income, the court may calculate income based on prior work history and/or the parent\u2019s potential earning capacity[1]. If the judge believes that the parent is deliberately not earning an income to reduce their obligation to pay child support, the judge may \u201cimpute\u201d income to them, which means child support will be calculated based on what they should be earning rather than their actual income[2]. Generally, child support is calculated based on each parent\u2019s monthly income after taxes and alimony payments[5]. For example, if one parent earned 60% of the income in the household, the amount they would pay would be 0.60 multiplied by the baseline amount for care determined by the state[4]."}
{"answer": "Blankets work by preventing your body heat from radiating out into the environment[1]. They can also trap heat and moisture[3], so adding more blankets when it's cold outside can help keep your body warm. Cuddling can also help keep you warm, as it increases skin contact and decreases opportunities for the heat to be lost to the environment[5]."}
{"answer": "The media spends a lot of time covering candidates like Jeb Bush who are more popular because they tend to get higher ratings and more viewers. This creates a feedback loop where the more coverage a popular candidate gets, the more popularity they gain and the more coverage they get. This can trap non popular candidates in last place because they can't get the coverage they need to rise in the polls[3]. Additionally, some media spikes don't always translate into polling spikes[5], so it's possible that the media has more of an effect on popular candidates than less popular candidates."}
{"answer": "Sunni and Shia Muslims share many aspects of Islamic teachings in common, such as the belief in God, angels, Prophets, books, and the hereafter, and also the main practices of Islam such as praying five times a day, fasting the month of Ramadan, performing hajj, and paying charity[4]. The primary difference in practice comes in that Sunni Muslims mainly rely on the Sunnah, a record of the teachings and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad to guide their actions while the Shiites more heavily on their ayatollahs, whom they see as a sign of God on earth[2]. However, the main difference between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims is their belief surrounding who should have succeeded the Prophet Muhammad in 632 AD[3]. Sunnis also have a less elaborate religious hierarchy than Shiites have, and the two sects' interpretation of Islam's schools of law is different. Shiites give human beings the exalted status that is given only to prophets in the Quran, often venerating clerics as saints, whereas Sunnis do not[1]."}
{"answer": "The term \"film\" became a synonym for movies because it was historically the primary medium for recording and displaying motion pictures[1]. The word comes from the Old English root word \"filmen,\" which means \"membrane or thin skin\"[2]. Film refers to both the photographic strip of plastic that runs through a camera and captures the film's images, as well as the series of still photographs on film projected onto a screen using light in rapid succession, which creates the illusion of actual, smooth, and continuous movement[4]."}
{"answer": "The core beliefs of American political parties are based on the founding ideals and core values of the country. This includes the belief in liberty, equality, individualism, and the election process[1][4]. Parties also have an important role in connecting citizens to their government and providing alternatives to voters[2]. They also perform the essential tasks of recruiting and nominating candidates, gathering resources for campaigns, and pursuing a policy agenda that can appeal to voters[3]. However, many Americans have become disenchanted with partisan politics and have taken pride in their status as independent voters[5]."}
{"answer": "Broadcasters maximize advertising revenue during live sports by selling air time to advertisers, and by offering season-long packages to companies that have large advertising budgets. They also encourage advertisers to integrate their name into the game through sponsorships, such as timeouts and halftime breaks[1]. Additionally, radio advertising is often used in conjunction with television ads to strengthen a brand\u2019s image in a listener\u2019s mind and to keep listeners tuned in during commercial breaks[5]."}
{"answer": "Fevers are caused by chemicals in the bloodstream called pyrogens. When these pyrogens bind to certain receptors in the hypothalamus, which is in charge of regulating body temperature, the body temperature rises[2][3]. Fevers are more than just a symptom of illness or infection and they set in motion a series of mechanisms that regulate our immune system[4]. They also help fight off the illness because viruses thrive best at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and when the body is hotter, it's harder for the virus to survive[5]."}
{"answer": "When you swallow a pill, it can sometimes feel like it is stuck in the back of your throat. This is because the pill may be stuck to the side of your throat, which can cause pain, anxiety, and inflammation. It can also cause esophagitis, a condition where the esophagus becomes inflamed[4], which can make swallowing difficult and painful. The pill may also be stuck in the esophagus on the way down to the stomach[4][5]. To reduce this feeling, it is recommended to take a few gulps of water, as this feeling usually goes away in 30 to 60 minutes[1]."}
{"answer": "Despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963, the gender wage gap in the US has been slow to narrow, with women earning about 60 cents for every dollar earned by men at the time[3]. This slow progress can be attributed to a variety of factors, including continued discrimination in the labor market, a lack of enforcement of the Equal Pay Act, and structural factors that have led to women having less access to high-paying jobs and higher-level positions. Additionally, the gender wage gap increases as men and women grow older, and is larger when comparing married men and women than for singles[5]."}
{"answer": "Eye-makeup, such as eyeliner and mascara, can have a dramatic impact on how attractive women are perceived because it allows them to make their faces look more symmetrical than they actually are[1]. Additionally, makeup can alter the apparent size of facial features, such as making eyes appear larger[3], which is a sexually dimorphic trait among females. Furthermore, women wearing bold and sexy makeup, such as eye shadow and dark/bright lipstick, are perceived as more promiscuous[5], which could also make them appear more attractive. It is likely that this perception is at least partially due to socialization and conditioning."}
{"answer": "Sunglasses were originally used to protect pilots from harmful UV rays in the 1920s, but then became popularized through commercial marketing as the essence of cool[1]. Wearing sunglasses is a shortcut to catching people's eye, as they make people look more attractive and glamorous[2]. Certain brands like Oakley have become known as the \"cool guy brand\"[5], and celebrities and other cultural elites have popularized the trend, leading to society associating sunglasses with perceptions of coolness. However, sunglasses alone cannot make an otherwise irredeemable outfit look cool."}
{"answer": "To turn an extra wireless router into a wireless extender, you need to first make sure that the network name and password of the router match the rest of the network[2]. Then, you need to find a spot halfway between the network's router and the area you want to fill with Wi-Fi, with an AC outlet[4]. Finally, make sure that the extra router you're using supports at least the 802.11n Wi-Fi standard for optimal speeds[5]."}
{"answer": "The main difference between sashimi and sushi is that sushi always has rice, while sashimi is just raw seafood without any rice[1][2][3]. Another difference is that sashimi is served on its own, either as raw fish, or shellfish, without rice[3]. In terms of the style of sushi, there is a difference between Japanese-style sushi and Western-style sushi[4], where traditional Japanese sushi is simpler, less dressed up, and focused on the fish, while its American counterpart is more focused on rolls, topped with plenty of garnishes and sauces[5]."}
{"answer": "Bluetooth is generally slower than Wi-Fi because it operates in the same 2.4GHz frequency band and uses similar frequency hopping algorithms, resulting in less bandwidth[1]. Additionally, Wi-Fi is capable of streaming high-quality music, video content, and other large data streams, while Bluetooth is limited in its capability[2]. Furthermore, Wi-Fi is able to achieve much higher download speeds (10+ Mbps) and lower ping times (60 ms) than Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR[3], and Bluetooth tethering is much slower than Wi-Fi, with a maximum speed of 1.7 Mb/s. Lastly, Wi-Fi is superior to Bluetooth in terms of range and speed[3][5]."}
{"answer": "The International Space Station (ISS) takes advantage of several methods to avoid damage from the solar wind. The ISS is placed in a high-inclination orbit, which means that it spends part of every 90-minute circumnavigation at high latitudes, where Earth's magnetic field is less effective at shielding impinging radiation[2]. Mission schedules are also designed to minimize astronaut exposure to the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) during extravehicular activity (EVAs)[1]. Near-term actions include programmatic and operational ways to take advantage of the multiagency assets that currently monitor and forecast space weather, and ways to improve the in situ measurements and the predictive power of current models[4]. Lastly, the ISS moves along its 16 orbits per day, and its per-orbit risk of exposure to solar energetic particles varies from zero to a maximum that depends on the size of the SPE zones[5]."}
{"answer": "Tearing up when you yawn is likely due to the facial muscles you use when your mouth is wide open[1][3]. When we yawn, our facial muscles get tightened, and our eyes get scrunched up, which can cause extra tears to spill out[3]. This is because when you yawn, you use a lot of muscles in your face, including your jaw, cheeks, and eyes[5]. While it is normal for some people to tear up when they yawn, it doesn't happen to everyone[3]. Research is still being conducted to understand why this happens, but for now it is just a harmless quirk of the human body[4]."}
{"answer": "Humans did not evolve into several different species due to the separation of Pangaea because the separation of Pangaea happened hundreds of millions of years before humans evolved on the planet[5]. During the time of the separation of Pangaea, the continents were already in their current configuration, and the first hominids (Humans and our closest relatives / ancestors) only evolved about 500,000 years ago[4][5]. Even though the separation of Pangaea was responsible for the mass extinction event at the end of the Permian Period, which led to an increase in biodiversity as habitats emerged and separated animal populations[3], this did not lead to the evolution of humans into several different species."}
{"answer": "Canadian healthcare is different from Obamacare in several ways. In Canada, physicians are private providers rather than government employees, whereas in the US, the individual mandate relies on a fundamental insurance principle and compels Americans to purchase insurance to access care[2]. Additionally, health care in Canada is universal and based on a simple proposition that every legal resident is covered through a publicly-financed provincial or territorial plan[2], whereas Obamacare does not provide universal coverage and reinforces the notion that access depends on how much you can afford[3]. Furthermore, in the US, about half of Americans get insurance through their employer, usually paid for through a combination of employer and employee payments[4], whereas in Canada, access to necessary health care services is not a competitive sport[2][3]. Finally, Canada fares better than the United States with regard to coverage, cost, and health outcomes[5]."}
{"answer": "The SAP button does not work in reverse because journal entries created directly within Financial Accounting are the only ones that can be reversed[5]. Entries with source documents, such as goods issues or customer invoices, cannot be reversed since they originate outside of Financial Accounting[5]. The Reverse Button is greyed out and inactive when accessing the App Manage Journal Entries[2], and it is not possible to reverse journal entries[2]. The Reverse button is used in the final step of the SAP bill of exchange process once the bills have been paid by the customer on the due date[1], and is used to reverse the contingent liability[2]."}
{"answer": "Pencil graphite is referred to as lead instead of graphite because the material was historically misidentified as lead and the name stuck[4][5]. When the graphite pencil was first developed and popularized in the 1600's, no one knew the chemical nature of this material, as chemistry itself was still in its infancy[5]. Since this writing material behaved similar to metallic lead, but had a darker color, people began calling it \"black lead\"[5]. Eventually, the name of the core of the pencil got shortened to \"lead\"[2][5]."}
{"answer": "The idea that losing a shoe in an accident equals death is an old wives tale that has been around for a long time and is believed to come from old PSAs, safety videos, tv, and movies[3]. It is not a guarantee that someone will die if their shoes have flown off in an accident but it is an easy way to tell that a significant force threshold has been exceeded, and that it is unlikely the person is OK[2]. On Reddit, this idea has been perpetuated because of cartoons and media where 'non' fatal injuries are dealt and the shoes fly off, as well as r/wtf and r/morbidreality style gifs of people being killed with a shoe-removing blow[1]. The connection being made is that the crashes almost always look so bad that the guy dies[5]."}
{"answer": "The different branches of Christianity are no longer combated as heresy due to a variety of factors. One is the concept of adiaphora, or \u201cindifferent things\u201d, which means that theological differences are allowed and people are encouraged to \u201clive and let live\u201d. With the Reformation in the 16th century, most Protestant churches drastically revised the notion of heresy and allowed for people to maintain the doctrines of their own communion while not regarding those who hold different views as heretics[2]. Additionally, the lack of a central doctrinal authority in Protestantism has meant that beliefs can often not be unanimously considered heretical[3]. Furthermore, a person must be baptized to commit heresy, meaning that movements that do not practice baptism (or valid baptism) are not heresies, but separate religions[4]. Lastly, Walter Bauer's Rechtgl\u00e4ubigkeit und Ketzerei im \u00e4ltesten Christentum argued that originally unity was based on a common relationship with the same Lord rather than on formally defined doctrines, and Henry Chadwick's account suggests that all Christian communities were linked by the foundational events which occurred in Jerusalem[5]."}
{"answer": "Animal cloning is a technique for the production of genetically indistinguishable copies of the desired animal[2]. It has been used in a number of different applications, such as producing animals with gene mutations to study diseases, producing livestock like cows and pigs with more milk or meat, and even \u201cresurrecting\u201d beloved pets[1]. Scientists have successfully cloned cattle, swine, sheep, goats, mice, rats, rabbits, cats, mules, horses, and one dog[3]. Animal cloning can help progress current research and fight the battle against diseases, and can also be used to replace a lost pet[4]. However, animal cloning can lead to the reduction of genetic diversity and can be expensive and inefficient in comparison to sexual reproduction[5]."}
{"answer": "It is possible that an alien civilisation could develop a strikingly similar language to English, due to universal structures in the physical, biological, and social worlds[1]. However, it is unlikely that humans would be able to learn an alien language that violates universal grammar[1][4], and the internal structure of an alien language is a difficult question[1][3][4]. Additionally, any alien language is likely to be communicated in a different frequency range than humans can perceive[4], which could make it difficult for humans to understand. However, it is plausible that any technologically versatile alien civilisation would have something like language, as language is the single most important factor in human cooperation[5]."}
{"answer": "The main difference between a parliamentary and presidential system of government is that in a presidential system, the president is separate from the legislative body, while in a parliamentary system, the chief executive, such as a prime minister, is part of the legislative body, or parliament[1][2]. It is also much easier for the legislature to remove the prime minister in a parliamentary system, while a president is more difficult to remove from his or her position[1][2]. Additionally, in a presidential system, the chief executive and members of the legislature are elected separately by the people, while in a parliamentary system, the legislature is elected by the people and then must appoint or recommend for appointment one of its members to be the chief executive[2]. Apart from the parliamentary and presidential systems, there can also be a hybrid system incorporating features of both systems[1][4]. In parliamentary systems, the head of government and parliament is the Prime Minister, and citizens elect the members of Parliament, which makes up the legislative branch of government[2][3]. Additionally, in parliamentary systems, the executive is responsible to the legislature, and the executive loses its power when it loses confidence in the legislature[1][2][5]."}
{"answer": "We are considered to be carbon-based because carbon is the best universal organic base, due to its stable 4 bonds[1][2]. It is also the \"glue\" that holds the hydrogen and oxygen atoms together, which make up the majority of our bodies (70%)[1]. Additionally, carbon is necessary for complex biochemical reactions to take place in the body[2]. Other substances, such as ammonia, formaldehyde, sulphuric acid, liquid nitrogen, hydrogen fluoride, methane, hydrocarbons, and supercritical fluids[4], can also be used as solvents, but carbon is the most suitable base for our bodies.[2]"}
{"answer": "Speed limits are set primarily to balance road traffic safety concerns with the effect on travel time and mobility[4]. Speed limits are used to create a safe and consistent flow of traffic, reduce consumption of fuel, and respond to environmental concerns[4]. Lower speed limits are imposed if the road is narrow and winding, or if it is situated in densely-populated urban areas[1]. Studies have found that when drivers exceed speed limits, they increase their chances of crashing. This is because a wide range of speeds between vehicles can cause accidents[2]. Therefore, speed limits are set rather than a speed range to ensure that drivers maintain a consistent speed and reduce the chances of accidents."}
{"answer": "Time was standardized because it is a universal quantity that is required by everyone, up to a certain precision[5]. It was also easier to standardize a system if fewer people used it[5]. Additionally, measuring time on a smaller scale used to be much harder than measuring length or weight, so most people simply didn't bother[5]. The world is still unable to agree on standard units of measurement for anything except time because the other units are still measured metrically and not standardized, and because primitive measures such as the finger, foot, or a random stone are still being used[3]."}
{"answer": "Companies still believe that investing in online ads, such as on YouTube, is worth it because they offer valuable, native ads that feel like a part of the overall YouTube experience, and that won't frustrate viewers and drive them to turn on AdBlock[1]. Additionally, they can serve ads pre-roll or mid-roll that viewers can\u2019t skip, and pay per impression at a cost per 1,000 views[2]. Furthermore, even though people have the ability to block YouTube ads, the majority of YouTube\u2019s 2.56 billion users don\u2019t have an ad blocker installed, meaning companies are still likely to reach their target audience[4]. Finally, YouTube accepts the loss of ad costs from ad blockers because their main goal is to have as many people using their platform as possible[5]."}
{"answer": "Quantum suicide and quantum immortality are concepts related to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Quantum suicide is a thought experiment in which a variation of the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment is used to test an interpretation of quantum mechanics other than the many-worlds interpretation[1][4]. Quantum immortality refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide[1][2][4]. Hugh Everett did not mention quantum suicide or quantum immortality in writing, but some believe that he believed his many-worlds theory guaranteed him immortality[2]. As a thought experiment, quantum suicide is an intellectual exercise in which an abstract setup is followed through to its logical consequences merely to prove a theoretical point[3]. Anthony Aguirre, while personally skeptical of most accounts of the many-worlds interpretation, believes that quantum suicide may be applicable to real-world causes of death, but notes that most causes of death do not fulfill the two requirements for quantum suicide and that it would be foolish in the extreme to let this possibility guide one's actions in any life-and-death question[3][4]. As a form of Pascal's Wager for suicide, quantum suicide is extremely effective at making people not want to test it[5]."}
{"answer": "A burning sensation in the nose can be caused by various things, including allergies, a cold, the flu, a sinus infection, smoke inhalation, inhalation of potentially harmful substances such as industrial chemicals, polyps, and possibly COVID-19[4]. Treatment for nose burning depends on the underlying cause[4]."}
{"answer": "Sinkholes typically happen when the rock below the land surface is limestone, carbonate rock, salt beds, or rocks that can naturally be dissolved by groundwater circulating through them[3]. As the rock dissolves, spaces and caverns develop underground and if there is not enough support for the land above the spaces, then a sudden collapse of the land surface can occur[3]. Sinkholes can also be triggered by gradual dissolution or by human activities such as building roads, aquifers, or other types of construction[5]. Altering land in these ways can weaken the underlying rock and make it more susceptible to sinkholes.[5]"}
{"answer": "It is possible that mobile ads are intentionally the last thing to load while opening a page, since accidental clicks on mobile devices are quite common and can quickly eat up an advertiser's budget. Google has attempted to reduce the volume of these accidental clicks by reducing the clickability of their ad units[4]. They have also implemented protections like edge clicks and fast clicks to help prevent accidental clicks and improve the experience with mobile ads for users and advertisers[5]."}
{"answer": "Lobbying activities can greatly benefit society by providing access for stakeholders to complex government decision-making processes[2], helping to build urgency for an issue and providing consistent awareness of an issue[3], aggregating personal interests into lobby groups to strengthen their voice[4], and providing legislatures with expert knowledge on a subject matter they may not be educated enough on[4]."}
{"answer": "Hot water in hotels is usually produced by heating water with electrical energy from fossil fueled generators[4], or by using water heaters that draw electricity[5]. In large hotels, the hot water is distributed to all areas of the building using multiple heat exchangers, pressure pumps, and holding tanks[3]. This ensures that the water never gets cold and hot water can be pushed from the holding tanks when needed[3]. This system is used to accommodate the increased demand for hot water in hotels due to the many uses, such as bathing, laundry, and heat systems like Jacuzzi and Sauna[2]."}
{"answer": "Pornography sites stay in business by cooperating with rival sites and sharing traffic[1], as well as utilizing effective marketing techniques that are more appealing to their customers such as blind linking and pop-up windows[4]. They also invest a lot of money into technological advances such as upgrading servers and developing broadband capabilities[5], in order to make access faster and easier for their users. Additionally, the pornography industry has more leeway to conduct technological experiments than mainstream companies[5]."}
{"answer": "Encryption works by using an encryption key to scramble the data, which makes it unreadable to anyone who does not have the key. The encryption key is a piece of information that controls the cryptographic process and permits a plain-text string to be encrypted and decrypted[2]. In order to protect against the possibility of the NSA obtaining the key, it is possible to use a technique called OTP (one time pad) in combination with other encryption methods, so that even if one of the encryption methods is broken, the data is still secure[3]. Additionally, encryption keys may have an active life shorter than an authorized user's access to the data, so the old key can be archived and used only for decryption, and the new key will be used to encrypt and decrypt data[4]. Finally, full disk encryption is a good starting point for ordinary people to start using encryption because it provides strong encryption, is built into all major operating systems, and takes minimal effort to use[5]."}
{"answer": "The cost of making and shipping pennies includes some fixed costs that the US Mint would continue to incur even if we abolished the penny, because the Mint would still make other coins[3]. However, producing the penny still costs taxpayers money, as in 2021 each penny produced cost 2.10 cents to make and distribute[5]. Aaron Klein estimates that the United States could see $1.78 billion in losses over the next 30 years if the penny remains in production[1]. Without pennies, the Mint would be forced to make more five-cent pieces, which would cost an estimated $10.9 million more annually than it would cost to keep making pennies[4]. So, even though the cost and production of other coins and bills might counteract the defecit of making pennies to some extent, it is still a big deal because the cost of producing the penny is still much higher than its value."}
{"answer": "Fascism is a form of far-right authoritarian ultranationalism[5] which is a system of government led by a dictator who typically rules by forcefully and often violently suppressing opposition and criticism, controlling all industry and commerce, and promoting nationalism and often racism[3]. It is often considered a form of totalitarianism[4][5], in which the government controls almost every aspect of ordinary life. It involves an alliance of hardline and moderate conservatives seeking to repress left-wing sentiment[1][4] and collaboration with capitalists and the conservative elite[1][2]. It has a focus on resurrecting an illustrious past and propelling the nation forward, to expand with industry, military weapons and technology. The main problem with fascism is that it suppresses opposition, dissent and criticism, and can be very oppressive.[1]"}
{"answer": "The argument of \"Separation of Church and State\" and \"Under God\" in the Pledge is a controversial topic. Opponents of the phrase argue that it violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which protects minority rights against majority will[1]. Proponents of the phrase argue that the US is a Christian nation, that the language reflects its civic culture and is not a religious statement, and that federal law, state constitutions, and US currency already contain references to God[2]. The phrase was added to the pledge in 1954 by a Catholic organization, the Knights of Columbus, and signed by President Dwight Eisenhower[3]. Critics of the phrase argue that the use of it violates the separation of church and state, which is not actually found in the Constitution or any other founding legislation[3][4]. A current Massachusetts case challenges the Pledge from a different perspective, arguing that the recitation of the pledge discriminates against non-believing students and thus violates the guarantee of equal rights contained in the Massachusetts Constitution[5]."}
{"answer": "The main difference between Dijon mustard and yellow mustard is in the flavor. Dijon mustard has a more complex flavor and is spicier than yellow mustard, which has a slightly sweeter taste[1][2][5]. Dijon mustard is also creamier than yellow mustard and contains less vinegar[2][3]. In terms of appearance, dijon mustard has a thicker consistency, while yellow mustard is runnier and has a consistency like ketchup[3]. Both types of mustard have a strong taste that can overpower other flavors if used in excess[4]. Finally, Dijon mustard is made with white wine, while yellow mustard uses soy sauce in its preparation[1]."}
{"answer": "There are several reasons why famous people are not getting assassinated. One is that few people are willing to give up their freedom and possibly their lives just to murder a celebrity they don't even care about[2]. Another reason is that since famous people have security, anyone who does want to get famous for murder have easier options that don't involve killing a celebrity[2]. Additionally, many leaders are morally appalled at the idea of assassinating their rivals or enemies, or concerned about its practical implications[5]. Finally, assassinations have a dramatic effect and can have a major impact on political movements/parties[4]."}
{"answer": "Yes, fruit and vegetables evolved too. Botanical fruit, which includes some vegetables (like cucumbers), but not others (like celery), evolved specifically to be eaten by animals[1]. Research suggests that the way ancient artists depicted these foods shows what they probably looked like at the time[2]. Before modern cultivation, ancient tomatoes were the size of berries, potatoes were no bigger than peanuts, corn was a wild grass, cucumbers were spiny as sea urchins, lettuce was bitter and prickly, and peas were so starchy and unpalatable that they had to be roasted like chestnuts and peeled[3]. Modern-day crops no longer resemble what they used to be and are much larger, sweeter, and easier to eat[4]."}
{"answer": "Speed caps are used by ISP's to limit the speed of data that is either ingoing to your device or outgoing to a network, or limit the total number of data sent or received at a given time[1]. ISP's claim that increased demand for content such as high-definition video and the use of peer-to-peer networking services are overwhelming their ability to deliver a consistent connection to the end user, thus necessitating the implementation of a bandwidth cap to improve the experience for the consumer[2]. The use of data caps has been criticized for becoming increasingly unnecessary, as decreasing infrastructure costs have made it cheaper for ISPs to increase the capacity of their networks to keep up with the demands of their users, rather than place arbitrary limits on usage[3]. U.S. internet service providers have most recently asserted that data caps are needed in order to provide \"fair\", tiered services at different price points based on speed and usage[3][4]. Mobile data providers use a soft cap to limit high-bandwidth activities, like streaming[5]. Soft caps work by throttling your speeds once you use a certain amount of your monthly data, which helps conserve your remaining data for the month.[5]"}
{"answer": "Short-sightedness (myopia) is a very common eye condition and affects approximately 15 per cent of the population[3]. It occurs when the clear front surface of the eye (the cornea) curves too steeply or the eyeball is too long[5], which causes light entering the eye to not focus on the back of the eye (retina), but focuses in front of the retina so the image appears blurry[5]. If you look in a mirror which is close to your face, objects in the distance (in the mirror) will still look blurry, because the lens in your eye cannot adjust for the amount of spread the light has taken over that distance[2]. A convex mirror can cause the object to appear even farther away as it spreads the light even more, again making it blurry if you're short sighted[2]."}
{"answer": "A hair transplant is a medical procedure that involves transferring hair follicles from a donor area, usually the back of the head, to a bald or thinning area of the scalp[3][4]. This is usually done using individual hair follicles which are harvested one by one with a tiny motorized punch, or by extracting a thin strip of the hair-bearing scalp grafts and closing the area with a row of stitches or sutures[4]. The most popular method of hair transplantation is Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT), which has a low graft rejection rate of 5% and a high yield of up to 90%[2]."}
{"answer": "Graphics cards are identified by a combination of letters and numbers. The first number in the name (e.g. 7 in GTX 760) generally indicates the generation of cards it belongs to and can be used as a general performance indicator[4]. The second number in the name (e.g. 6 in GTX 760) usually indicates the performance level of the card[1]. For NVIDIA cards, the 700-735 cards are considered low-end or mainstream cards and the 740-765 range are performance cards[1]. Enthusiast-class cards are the 770 cards and beyond[1]. For AMD cards, the 500 series to the Vega series, the 5000 series, and the 6000 series are the current generations[4][5]. After you've determined which series the card is, you can then figure out the performance value; typically, a higher number corresponds to a more powerful video card[5]. The XT models indicate a slightly faster variant of the non-XT models[5]."}
{"answer": "You can hear a TV from another room, even if the volume is off, because the electronic components in the TV are still vibrating[1]. This high frequency noise is constantly on, even with the volume muted[2][3]. Although the volume is off, the speakers are still producing vibrations, which is why the TV can be heard from another room."}
{"answer": "In the American healthcare system, \"single payer\" refers to a system in which one entity (usually a government agency) collects all health care fees and pays for all health care costs, replacing private health insurance companies and patient co-payments[2][3]. There is no consensus on the definition of single-payer, but it is generally characterized as one entity that collects funds and pays for health care on behalf on an entire population[4]."}
{"answer": "Gatorade is mass produced by PepsiCo and is distributed in over 80 countries[3]. It is manufactured in research facilities, pilot plants, and full scale industrial plants[5]. The researchers figure out the exact formula they want for a product, then it is scaled up for the pilot plant so they can figure out how to mass produce it and get the engineering kinks worked out, and then it goes to full scale production[5]. The brand has a marketing strategy that enables it to hold an astonishing 70%-80% of the global sports drink industry with worldwide sales worth USD 6.7 billion in retail volume[4]."}
{"answer": "An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other[1][4]. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software and is code that enables two software programs to communicate[1]. It is also a method for calling computer code to be carried out[2]. APIs originated in the 1940s, though the term did not emerge until the 1960s and 1970s[3]."}
{"answer": "The main difference between satire and parody is that satire is the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people\u2019s stupidity or vices, while parody is the imitation of the style of a particular author, artist, or genre with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect[1][4]. Satire is focused on the bigger picture and has a deeper purpose than parody, which is often a shallow instance of mimicry with little lasting impact[2]. Satire is defined as the use of humor to criticize people\u2019s vices, while parody is defined as a literary or musical work in which the style of an author or work is closely imitated for comic effect or in ridicule[1][4]. Parody is based on other artists\u2019 work that is exaggerated for entertainment only, while satire directly aims at the malpractices of the society using humor[5]."}
{"answer": "There are several reasons why insurance is handled by private, for-profit companies rather than by the government. One is that private health insurance schemes are defined as those that are wholly or partially financed and managed by an entity (organisation/institution/company) that is not state-owned, irrespective of whether it is a for-profit or a not-for-profit entity [1]. Another reason is that the potential for profits motivates insurers to seek greater efficiency in the way they pay for health care, and if more individuals bought their own insurance, rather than having their employers do it for them, the prospect of profit would motivate more insurers, doctors, and hospitals to offer what consumers want: more options and lower prices [2]. Additionally, private for-profit insurance companies are incentivized to pursue economic efficiencies and constantly seek ways to boost corporate earnings[3] and provide different types of policies for different amounts of money and different levels of protection[4]. Finally, government insurance programs may be based on weak rationales and may not be justified[5]."}
{"answer": "The major differences between major fighting games and how they are played competitively are the game engines, characters, stages, controls and mechanics. Street Fighter has a deeper engine that allows for more depth in terms of characters, with bigger characters being slower, and smaller characters being faster[2]. Mortal Kombat is more focused on the concept of fighters from all around the world, with a more developed background for each character, and controls that are easier to learn[2]. Street Fighter is a 2D game with cartoon graphics and has a more complicated list of combos and special moves, while Mortal Kombat is 3D and focuses more on the \"fatality\" aspect[4]. In terms of competitive play, Mortal Kombat is still a staple in the fighting game scene, while Street Fighter is often seen as the more complicated and challenging game to master[3][4]."}
{"answer": "Financing a car through a bank can be cheaper than financing through the dealership even though dealerships may have lower interest rates. This is because banks may already have an established relationship with customers and offer them lower interest rates and incentives than dealerships[2]. Banks also offer preapproval options which can make it easier to compare loan offers and relieve pressure at the dealership[3]. Additionally, when financing through a bank you have the advantage of shopping around to get the best deal that best aligns with your budget and credit profile[5]."}
{"answer": "We do not yet know the perfect diet for humans because there is likely no single natural diet that is best for human health[2]. Humans can be very healthy on a wide range of diets, and we see a wide range of diets in very healthy populations[3]. This is likely due to the fact that humans evolved to eat a wide variety of diets all over the world, from the Arctic to the tropics, desert, plains, and mountains[5]. Therefore, the perfect diet for humans is likely one that is balanced and comprised of real food."}
{"answer": "The rules of Australian Rules Football are as follows: it is a contact sport played between two teams of 18 players on an oval field[1]; points are scored by kicking the oval ball between the central goal posts (worth six points), or between a central and outer post (worth one point, otherwise known as a \"behind\")[1]; a hybrid code known as international rules football is played between Australia's state leagues and the Gaelic Athletic Association[2]; the purpose of the laws is to explain how a match is played and seek to attain certain objectives[3]; it is a fast-paced, physically demanding sport that often resembles a mass brawl[4]; and it has been around since 1841 in some form or another[5]."}
{"answer": "Airplanes don't have headlights in the traditional sense, but they do have a variety of illuminations performing different functions[1][2]. Landing lights are the most common illuminations on an airplane, located along the forward fuselage, in the outboard wing, or in the wing root[5]. Other lights include red and green LEDs on each wing to indicate to other aircraft which direction the plane is facing[4], and anti-collision beacon lights on the top and bottom of the fuselage, which are turned on as long as the plane's engines are running[4]."}
{"answer": "Sleeping in a colder room can improve your sleep quality and even help you combat insomnia episodes[5]. This is because our body temperature naturally drops at night, slowing down our metabolism rate and spending less energy during sleep[5]. Additionally, sleeping in a cold room can rev up your metabolism[2][5], which helps to lower your risk of disease and boost the production of growth hormones. Cold weather may also make it more difficult to fall asleep and alter your cardiac autonomic response if you're too cold during sleep[3]."}
{"answer": "It depends on the type of license that was purchased for the software. If the license is a Volume Licensing program, the product keys listed in the VLSC should only be used with that specific volume license and are only intended for use by one organization[1][4]. If the software was purchased with a retail key, it is the most flexible type of license and can be reused on different computers[2][5]. The license key will be displayed in the \"Downloads and Keys\" section if the agreement authorizes access to a product that requires a key[3]."}
{"answer": "Contagions can spread from contact with an open wound to the target organ in the body through hematogenous spread. In this process, the virus spreads to other organs through the bloodstream by entering the interstitial fluid that bathes all our cells within the tissues. Virions then enter the lymphatic vessels, which lead back to lymph nodes, and then continue within the lymph and eventually returned to the bloodstream[1]. Contagions can also spread through contact with contaminated objects or surfaces[2][3], through sexual contact[2], from a mother to her unborn child through body fluids[2], and through airborne droplets from an infected person when they talk, cough or sneeze."}
{"answer": "Increasing the minimum wage can have both positive and negative impacts on people. It can raise the earnings and family income of low-wage workers, potentially lifting some families out of poverty[2][3]. However, it can also cause other low-wage workers to become jobless, and their family income would fall[3]. The effects of a minimum wage increase vary depending on the magnitude of the increase and the local economy and cost of living in the region[4]. It can also affect employment, as it increases the cost of employing low-wage workers and can cause some employers to employ fewer workers[3][5]."}
{"answer": "Trained muscles get more volume rather than density because doing more volume helps you work more muscle groups, increasing the full-body strengthening effect of your workout[1]. Density training workouts typically involve supersets or circuits to increase the amount of weight you actually lift, combined with limited recovery periods[4]. This type of workout is recommended because it increases the amount of work you do without spending more time in the gym[5]. Training for dense muscle or big muscle comes down to your end goals[3]. If you want to become more powerful or improve athletic performance, you might want to train for dense muscles, which means heavier weights, lower reps, and more focus on compound movements[3]. On the other hand, if your end goal is to build a great physique, you might want to train for hypertrophy or bigger muscles[3]."}
{"answer": "The European Union was created to bind the nations of Europe closer together for the economic, social, and security welfare of all[2]. It is one of several efforts after World War II to bind together the nations of Europe into a single entity[2]. The European Union was created as a result of post-war cooperation in Europe to ensure peace, prosperity, and stability on the continent[1]. The EU is able to maintain its mission of continuing prosperity, freedom, communication and ease of travel and commerce for its citizens through the various treaties making it function, cooperation from member states, and its unique governmental structure[4]."}
{"answer": "Yes, he may be violated Federal Interstate laws if the crime occurs in a part of the city that is divided into two states. This is because some criminal acts are federal offenses only and must be prosecuted in U.S. District Court[2]. Examples of such crimes include, but are not limited to, bank robbery, drug cases, guns, and kidnapping. Additionally, when a railroad has already provided adequate accommodations at any point, a law that requires interstate trains to stop at such point imposes an invalid, unreasonable burden on interstate commerce[3]. Furthermore, a law that forfeits the right of an admitted foreign carrier to do a local business upon its instituting a right of action in a federal court imposes an unconstitutional condition[3]. Finally, according to federal law, all prosecutions for crimes or offenses must be had within the division of the district where the same were committed, unless the court or judge orders the cause to be transferred for prosecution to another division of the district[4]."}
{"answer": "The ozone hole is still there, but it is on its way to recovering due to unprecedented international action taken to reduce the use of human-made substances that disrupt the ozone layer. The hole was first discovered in 1985 by scientist Joseph C. Farman and his colleagues, who found that atmospheric ozone over Antarctica had reduced by 40 percent[2]. If no action had been taken, the decreased ozone levels of the hole would have eventually covered the entire planet[4]. The hole is a human-caused hole in the ozone layer above the South Pole during the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s spring, caused by the use of gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in spray cans and refrigerants[5]."}
{"answer": "The cool patterns that you see when you put pressure on your eyes for an extended period of time are known as \"phosphenes\", which are constructs of the cortex in response to signals from the retina, but stimulated by pressure rather than light[1]. However, it is not recommended to do this often or with any significant pressure, as it can cause non-repairable damage to the eye and lead to vision loss[1]. Other causes of eye strain include looking at screens for a long time or focusing on something for an extended period without a break[3], using a computer or tablet/phone at uncomfortable angles[4], and reading, writing, or performing close activities like sewing[5]."}
{"answer": "The United States and Saudi Arabia have been allies for over seven decades based on an exchange of security guarantees and access to the kingdom's vast oil reserves[5]. They share a strong economic relationship, with the United States being Saudi Arabia's second largest trading partner[2][4], and Saudi Arabia being one of the United States' largest trading partners in the Middle East[2][4]. They also have common interests in regional security, oil exports and imports, and sustainable development[4]. Additionally, the US-Saudi alliance is resilient due to their close consultations on international, economic, and development issues, as well as the fact that the alliance is transactional, and only as strong as the benefits both countries get out of it[3]."}
{"answer": "Brick and mortar retailers can continue to exist with online competitors by making adaptations to stay strong in their market and diversifying their business\u2019 revenue streams[1]. They can also maintain their share of the business and combat the growing e-commerce trend by joining in on the growth instead of falling prey to its projected success[3]. Additionally, brick-and-mortar businesses are still holding up well versus online retail sites, as many people still prefer the in-store shopping experience[4]. Furthermore, brick-and-mortar retailers can take advantage of improving online technology and strengthening their customer relationships by following digital marketing tips[5], which can generate greater ROI than they're used to seeing from traditional advertising.[5]"}
{"answer": "The reason why shower water become hotter when someone flushes the toilet is because of an old form of plumbing that isn't properly regulating the shower's water pressure[1][5]. When the toilet is flushed, cold water is temporarily siphoned away from the shower as the toilet refills, making the mixture of water coming out of the showerhead much hotter[2]. To fix this issue, it is important to schedule regular plumbing maintenance.[4]"}
{"answer": "It is likely that even the most isolated tribe in the world has interacted with outsiders in some way, whether face to face or by exposure to modern artifacts such as planes flying overhead and inter-tribal trading. They are also aware of the presence of outsiders and experts at living in the forest[1]. Most of our knowledge of uncontacted tribes comes from encounters with neighboring indigenous communities and aerial footage[2]. There are estimated to be between 100 and 200 tribes numbering up to 10,000 individuals[4], with the majority living in South America, particularly Brazil[4]."}
{"answer": "Hot objects glow because they are emitting light due to their high temperature. As an object heats up, it first turns red, then orange (red+yellow light), and finally white (red+yellow+blue looks white to the eye)[1]. This is due to the quantum mechanical processes that allow atoms to emit light[2]. The temperature at which an object starts to glow visibly is around 3000 to 3400 K (Kelvin), which is roughly 2700 to 3100 degrees Celsius. This is why stars and other objects can be approximated as black bodies and is a good model for understanding why hot things glow[4]. This is also why we naturally associate color with descriptions of hot things, as hot objects tend to glow red or white[5]."}
{"answer": "Antiseptic mouthwashes can kill nearly all germs and are most effective before getting sick, but they cannot get rid of a sore throat on their own[3]. The traditional approach to treating sore throat is to assume lozenges or gargling with antiseptics will reduce sore throat by treating the infection causing it[2]. However, gargling salt water may be more effective for eliminating the virus or bacteria that causes a sore throat, as it changes the pH level in your mouth and draws out the virus or bacteria[4]. Medicated gargles like Betadine Sore Throat Gargle, which contain povidone-iodine, may also help reduce the severity of your sore throat[5]."}
{"answer": "Infinity Tables are interactive coffee tables that feature over 960 LEDs, each individually controlled with 24bit color[3]. The LEDs make up a total of forty individual infinity mirrors that create an awesome effect[3]. These tables are popular among Infinity the Game players, who use them to create a dense table with an urban feel and emphasize the use of internals. Infinity Tables can be seen at two day ITS events, such as Burn City Brawl in Melbourne/Naarm[5]."}
{"answer": "PIN codes are not needed for online transactions because the use of a PIN number can help make transactions more secure by requiring an additional layer of identification from the buyer[5]. Also, PINs are usually only required by the merchant at the point of sale as opposed to being required for online purchases[1]. There are some circumstances at the physical point-of-sale terminals when a PIN is not required to authorize a transaction, most commonly at contactless terminals for purchases under $100 and low value payments under $35[2][3]. However, PINs are required for ATM transactions and for using debit cards in person."}
{"answer": "An orchestra conductor's primary job is to prepare the musical ensemble for public presentations by interpreting musical works and communicating those interpretations to the musicians via arm gestures[5]. Additionally, the conductor is also responsible for making creative and business decisions such as choosing repertoire, promoting orchestra events, recruiting new musicians, and resolving conflicts[3]. Lastly, the conductor serves as a messenger for the composer, conveying the music through gesture so the orchestra understands it perfectly[4]. In order for everyone to follow the conductor's cues, he or she must learn an entire score rather than its individual parts, and must expand their own expertise through advanced degrees and other events[1][5]."}
{"answer": "Governments cannot print \"temporary\" money to cover important expenses because doing so would lead to inflation and, in extreme cases, hyper-inflation[3]. This is because printing money in a situation where demand is running ahead of supply will cause the value of the money to decrease relative to the goods that can be purchased with it, resulting in a hidden tax for citizens due to higher costs of goods[3][5]."}
{"answer": "The cranes that are used to construct high-rise buildings and skyscrapers are called tower cranes[2]. There are three ways to make them taller: the external climbing method[3][5], the internal climbing method[3][4][5], and the 'skycrane' method of airlifting in a crane on a helicopter[2][3][4][5]. In the external climbing method, the base of the crane is fixed in a concrete slab in the ground, and the crane tower is erected beside the building using smaller, mobile cranes. Then, the crane is fastened to the building with steel collars, and new segments are inserted into the crane\u2019s backbone[5]. In the internal climbing method, the crane stands inside the center of the building, in a kind of makeshift courtyard, where it constructs the skyscraper around itself about a hundred feet at a time. A hydraulic cylinder at the crane\u2019s base elevates it through the hollow middle of the building to a higher floor[4]. Finally, in the 'skycrane' method, the crane is airlifted in to the higher floors on a helicopter[3][4][5]."}
{"answer": "Cooking wine is not regulated in stores like regular wine is because it is considered non-potable due to its large sodium content[1][2][4], which makes it especially dangerous for young people as it contributes to high blood pressure and kidney problems[2]. Additionally, because it is not intended to be consumed, IDs are not usually required when buying it[2][4]. Furthermore, it is not regulated by the liquor patrol board, meaning it can be purchased at grocery stores without an ID[2][3][5]."}
{"answer": "Cocaine is produced from the leaves of the coca plant (Erythoxylon coca)[1][2][4][5]. The leaves are harvested and soaked in gasoline and other solvents to extract the chemical cocaine hydrochloride[2][4][5]. The leaves are then drained and mixed with lime and cement to further extract the active chemical[2]. The leaves are usually soaked again before draining a final time[2]. Ultimately, the leaves are strained away and the resulting product is heated or dried and pressed into bricks for distribution[2]. The photos below, taken by the Associated Press' Rodrigo Abd in early 2016, show how coca leaves are made into paste and then into cocaine, revealing the humble origins of one of the world's most lucrative illegal drugs[3]."}
{"answer": "Dolphins are considered to be smart/advanced because they have extraordinarily large brains in comparison to body size and exhibit exceptional levels of emotional and social intelligence[1]. They are capable of complex problem solving and social interaction[1][3][4][5], and have the capacity to communicate through language, solve complex problems, use tools, and remember a great number of pod members for long periods of time[1]. They can learn new information and skills, and can pass that knowledge on to other dolphins, including their young[3][4]. Additionally, they can manipulate their surroundings for their benefit, such as wearing sponges on their rostrums to protect their snouts while hunting[2]."}
{"answer": "If a country invaded another and the invaded country couldn't afford to fight, the invading country would likely still keep on fighting. This was a common occurrence during the Middle Ages, as warfare was constant and power lay with substantial property owners. It was almost impossible for any medieval ruler of substance to avoid fighting for his entire career[1]. Warfare was dictated by the length that an archer could shoot an arrow, and by the strength of the arms that wielded swords and spears[2]. It was also fueled by a desire to protect or capture land and resources[2], and rulers were willing to risk confrontation with their vassals and taxpayers in order to build castles to protect their land[5]."}
{"answer": "There are several factors that make it difficult for the US to produce its own Messi. Firstly, producing truly elite goal-scoring talent is exceptionally difficult, requiring the perfect combination of ability, mental aptitude, opportunity, and hundreds of other factors that are difficult to quantify and impossible to game[3]. Additionally, even soccer-playing powerhouses like England, Spain, and France don't have anyone there[3]. Also, Messi is on the shortlist for \u201cbest player of ever\u201d, and it is not surprising that the US, a country that didn't really care about soccer until 20 years ago, hasn't produced one of the best players ever[5]. Finally, even with the increased access to money and youth players, it is still difficult to find the perfect combination of talent, motivation, and opportunity[1]."}
{"answer": "Increasing the minimum wage and setting a maximum wage could potentially help strengthen the middle class by creating a new floor and wage increases that will ripple through the wage distribution[1]. It would also reduce income inequality and serve as a foundation for job creation[1], while bringing relief to workers struggling to make ends meet[3]. Additionally, it would raise the incomes of people who make slightly more than minimum wage[3], as well as benefit the economy by increasing consumer activity, spurring job growth, and lowering the federal deficit[4]. Moreover, it could help reduce the federal budget deficit by lowering spending on public assistance programs and increasing tax revenue[5]."}
{"answer": "Cosplay is generally done for an event, such as a fan convention, where dedicated cosplayers will do a professional photo shoot with each of their costumes[2]. However, hardcore cosplayers may travel to multiple events in a year and wear multiple costumes for a 3-day convention[4]. Additionally, many cosplayers create their own outfits, referencing images of the characters, and may even use special materials to render the look and texture of the costume accurately[5]. Cosplayers may also wear wigs to further improve the resemblance to the character.[5]"}
{"answer": "Mercury is the chosen substance for determining the temperature because it is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature[2][4], it has a high coefficient of expansion[2], and it has much better conductivity and expands quickly, thus indicating a temperature adjustment swiftly[5]. It is also cheap to acquire and very accurate at measuring high temperatures[4] and does not require an external power source to operate[4]."}
{"answer": "Menstrual synchrony is the idea that women who spend a lot of time together will have their menstrual cycles align[1][2][3]. This phenomenon was first documented in a 1971 study by Martha McClintock, which found that over the course of a school year, period synchronization increased among roommates and close friends, but not among random pairings of women who hadn\u2019t been spending time together[4]. Since then, multiple studies have been conducted on female roommates, best friends, lesbian couples, and even animals to see if menstrual cycles actually converge while spending time together. However, many of these studies have mixed findings, and two in particular fail to replicate the 1971 study\u2019s results[5]."}
{"answer": "Stars appear to have points sticking out of them because of the diffraction of the light that enters through a small circular aperture, like the eye[1][3][5]. This diffraction creates a pattern consisting of a bright spot (Airy disk) surrounded by several concentric circles (Airy pattern)[3]. The 5 pointed star might have originated from the way the Egyptians represented the star in hyroglypics, or from the diffraction spikes that some very bright stars have[5]. This phenomenon is often mistaken for twinkling, but stars do not actually twinkle, they just appear to do so from our perspective on Earth[1][4]."}
{"answer": "When you put a cup near your ear, you are essentially amplifying the sound of the air rushing in between your ear and the cup. This is why the sound changes when you move the cup[1]. To help hear the faint sound better, try tweaking your cupped pinnae and point the cup in different directions[2]. You may have very sensitive ears if you find yourself squirming or wiggling when certain sounds trigger. It may help to put a fan on high or put your music up to block out the sound[5]."}
{"answer": "There are several reasons why you may feel too hot or cold when trying to sleep. If you're feeling too hot, it may be because the temperature of your room is too warm[1][3][4], or the bedding is too thick[3]. If you're feeling too cold, it may be because you've been staying up into the early-morning hours[2]. Additionally, certain medications or underlying medical conditions can contribute to feeling too hot[3][5], and having a naturally elevated body temperature has been associated with insomnia[4]. Lastly, it may be due to wearing too many layers of clothing or pajamas."}
{"answer": "It is possible to make an app that is a scale for an iPhone using the pressure sensitive touch technology. A few developers have already demonstrated that this can be done and have created real digital scale apps for the iPhone[1], however, Apple has denied access to these apps on the App Store[1][2][3]. There is, however, a web app called Pressure Scale that can be used, which does not exist in the App Store[1][5]."}
{"answer": "In space, rockets use a process called Newton's Third Law of Motion to thrust forward. This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the case of a rocket, the action is the expelling of gas out of the engine, and the reaction is the movement of the rocket in the opposite direction[5]. The gas that the rocket creates is going to naturally want to try to fill the empty space, and this is what creates the force that pushes the rocket forward[2]."}
{"answer": "The law allows companies to purchase or merge with other companies in order to comply with competition laws. The law bars mergers when the effect \"may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly\"[1][2]. Mergers and acquisitions must follow certain procedures and are divided into private and public acquisitions depending on whether the acquiree or merging company is listed on a public stock market[3]. The process of mergers and acquisitions in India is court driven and requires the sanction of the High Court[4]. In addition, Indian law ought to recognize contract based mergers between an Indian company and a foreign company and court based mergers between such entities where the foreign company is the transferee[5]. All of these measures help to prevent monopolization and keep competition alive."}
{"answer": "The United States FDA does not create a daily multivitamin they approve of because they do not review the safety or efficacy of supplements before they hit the market[1]. The FDA attempted to restrict the amount of each vitamin in any product to 150% of the U.S. RDA, and only allowing a few combinations of vitamins to be marketed as dietary supplements[2][3], but was forced to withdraw the proposed disclaimer[2]. The FDA was only able to move against the manufacturers and marketers on a case-by-case basis under the outdated and incomplete 1941 regulations[2][3]. Furthermore, the FDA does not regulate vitamin supplements like they do prescription medicines, and there are certain rules set by the FDA that supplement manufacturers are expected to follow, including the claims they can make on their labels[5]."}
{"answer": "There are several reasons why rain may make people tired. One is the lack of sunlight, which can have the opposite effect of releasing melatonin, which makes people feel drowsy, instead of serotonin, which makes people feel more alert and cheerful[2]. Additionally, the overcast, often gloomy atmosphere of a rainy day can also play a part in making people tired, as the lack of ultraviolet light can reduce serotonin, the so-called \u201chappiness hormone\u201d[1]. Furthermore, the pink noise caused by the sound of rain can also contribute to feeling tired. Lastly, lower barometric pressure, which tends to accompany stormy weather, reduces the amount of available oxygen in the air, and drowsiness is one of the first signs of insufficient oxygen[5]."}
{"answer": "Launch nuclear waste into space or the sun is not feasible due to the high cost and risk of rocket failure[1]. Additionally, nuclear waste is extremely hazardous and can cause contamination of the environment if it is not disposed of properly[2]. There have been some studies that have looked into the possibility of using high-powered lasers to blast capsules into space, but economic, reliability, safety, and legal issues have prevented this option from being pursued[4]. Moreover, hydrogen-fueled vehicles provide an alternative to electric vehicles that produce waste in the form of lithium batteries[5]."}
{"answer": "Smoking food is an effective form of food preservation because it relies on low heat[1][2], which kills microbes[3]. The combination of smoke and salt also helps preserve meat by acting as preservatives[3]. The smoke helps to dry the meat, which is accelerated by the addition of salt[3][5]. Additionally, in the past, smoking was used in combination with other techniques such as salt-curing or drying to further preserve food[5]."}
{"answer": "When you stare at a moving pattern for an extended period of time and then look away, the neurons that were firing in response to the moving pattern continue to fire, even though the moving pattern is no longer in focus[2]. Your brain is still predicting movement, and adjusts the image accordingly, which causes the objects to appear to wave as it tries to predict the movement[3]. This phenomenon is known as a peripheral drift illusion, and is caused by straining the eyes to focus on harsh patterns[5]."}
{"answer": "Saturday morning cartoons are idealized because they were a shared experience for many people growing up, as they were one of the few shared experiences[1]. They were also heavily promoted[4] and were a phenomenon that was unique to its time[1][3][5]. Saturday morning cartoons also had a specific target audience, as kids were more likely to stay indoors to watch them, as opposed to engaging in outdoor activities or playing video games[2]. They were also often created to meet regulations on children's television programming in the United States[5]."}
{"answer": "Television stations measure television viewing habits by using a rating system, often provided by the Nielsen Company. This system involves attaching devices to thousands of televisions in their network in order to track the average viewership of a show[1]. The Broadcasters' Audience Research Board in the UK also collects data from devices that are attached to televisions in households representative of the public to monitor viewing habits[1][2]. The information gathered from these ratings provides valuable insights into how many people are consuming content, as well as how and when they do so[3]. The Nielsen company measures it by hooking up special boxes to the TVs of a small number of people in each market, which actually monitors what you're watching[4]. In the U.S., the term \"TV ratings\" is synonymous with \"Nielsen\" because Nielsen Media Research has become the de facto national measurement service for the television industry[5]."}
{"answer": "In most cases, walking away from a home loan is not recommended, as it can come with serious consequences and is generally unadvisable. However, it may be a good idea in rare cases, such as if the homeowner discovers that the mortgage was actually presented to them through a scam or through mortgage fraud. In non-recourse states, there may be some situations when it makes mathematical sense to walk away from your mortgage, although it is important to understand all the risks and consult with a local attorney beforehand[4]. However, even if none of the many programs designed to help people pay their mortgage will help you, you still have better alternatives than just walking away[5]."}
{"answer": "The process of photographing the Supermoon is identical to photographing a regular Moon, with the advantage of it being larger and brighter[1]. Photographers aim to capture the magnitude of the Supermoon and its beautiful orange glow[2]. The location, the idea, the planning, and the camera settings are all important factors in taking a great picture of the Supermoon[3]. The necessary camera equipment includes a tripod, a telephoto lens, a wide-angle lens, and a camera with manual settings. The best time to shoot the Supermoon is during moonrise and moonset, when the sky is in the golden hour at sunset or sunrise[5]."}
{"answer": "Octanes are a family of hydrocarbons that are typical components of gasoline[1]. Octane gas comes in several different grades, with each number on the grade representing the resistance to burn the fuel has[2]. Stated simply, octane is a refined fuel with eight carbon atoms chained together[4]. An 87 octane fuel normally means it is comprised of 87 percent octane, and 13 percent of some other fuel type[4]. Automotive manufacturers are examining clean octane sources as a way to meet efficiency and greenhouse gas regulations[5]."}
{"answer": "We drink cow's milk instead of human milk because cow's milk is more readily available and has a better taste than human milk. Additionally, human milk is intended only for babies and it is considered cruel to take the milk away from calves for whom it is intended[2]. Drinking milk from cows has also been a practice for millennia[3], as cows lactate after having a baby (calf) and can be bottle fed by farmers if the mother is hooked to a milk machine[4]. Finally, drinking cow's milk may provide antibodies against some diseases that people may be exposed to when keeping livestock[5]."}
{"answer": "Silicon is often used in science fiction to create alien organisms because it is chemically plausible to base life on silicates (silicon oxides), which have a huge variety in nature[4]. Silicon-based life is usually portrayed as rock-like[3], and they are often depicted as Starfish Aliens. In addition, Siliconers are often unable to eat the same food as humans, which averts No Biochemical Barriers[5]."}
{"answer": "The current patent controversy between the top tech companies Google, MSFT, Apple, etc. involves a recent surge in litigation, with the Big 5 tech companies filing a total of 52,000 patent applications since 2009[1]. Apple and Google have recently lost legal battles over patents and have been facing hundreds of millions of potential costs[2]. In order to avoid these legal consequences, these major tech firms have been attempting to invalidate rivals\u2019 patents by pushing for legislation that would weaken IP protections[3]. This is part of a recent spike in patent litigation, with Google facing the highest number of patent lawsuits in the country[4]. The likely casualties of this patent war are the young startups that may get sued out of existence before they have a chance to become the next Google or the next Apple[5]."}
{"answer": "Games are typically cracked by bypassing digital rights management (DRM) technology designed to protect copyrighted content[3], which requires knowledge of machine language, and sometimes encryption, to make it work[1]. In some cases, crackers might have to buy the game for themselves and beat the game from start to finish in order to understand what a \u201cfull-featured\u201d system looks like[4]. Piracy is rampant across gaming platforms, with cracked games being widely available for free[5]."}
{"answer": "Carbon dating, also called radiocarbon dating, is a method of age determination that relies on the decay to nitrogen of radiocarbon (carbon-14) [4][5]. Carbon-14 is continually formed in nature by the interaction of neutrons with nitrogen-14 in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere [4]. Radiocarbon dating works by comparing the three different isotopes of carbon [1], which have the same number of protons in their nucleus but different numbers of neutrons [1]. Carbon-14 dating is used to date archeological artifacts of a biological origin up to about 50,000 years old [2], and researchers can use the decay of carbon-14 as a kind of clock to determine absolute dates for things like wood, food, pollen, poop, dead animals and humans [3]."}
{"answer": "It is taking them so long to come out with the consumer version of the Oculus Rift because they need to fulfill the orders of the more than 20,000 DK2 units that have been shipped and the more than 60,000 units that have been ordered[1]. Additionally, there may have been supply and production issues, as the company insider announced that certain components were no longer being manufactured, meaning they were no longer available to them for production[4]. Furthermore, it usually takes at least two or three years for consoles to go from the first developer kits being shipped to the actual launch of the product[2]. Finally, a lot happened in the one year between Oculus shipping their first developer kits and the start of pre-orders for version 2[5]."}
{"answer": "Different cheeses made from the same type of milk may have different Calcium values because the amount of calcium varies depending on the brand, the weight, and the cheesemaking process. The mineral content of cheese is largely determined by the quantity of calcium phosphate lost from the curd, which is mainly dependant upon the pH of the whey at drainage[4]. This pH is dependant on starter activity, which is influenced by several factors[4]. Additionally, Lawrence et. al. (1984) suggested that Cheddar is a popular variety because it can have a wide range for pH and calcium content and still meet customer expectations[1]."}
{"answer": "When water is photographed with a camera lens, it can cause a near perfect hexagon bokeh due to the blades of the camera diaphragm creating a polygonal-shaped aperture[1]. The type of lens you are using can influence the shape of the bokeh. Older lenses tend to produce straight edges and hexagonal shapes, while newer, more up-to-date lenses will produce a round, circular blur[2]. The bokeh is also affected by the lens\u2019 diaphragm blades, which is determined by the aperture[3]. Polygonal bokeh shapes, such as hexagons, can be harsh and distracting[4], so it is best to invest in a good lens to get the perfect bokeh effect[2]. If your lens has a tendency to produce strong hexagons, aside from avoiding point light source and reflections, you may need to replace the lens[5]."}
{"answer": "Pi is infinite because the number of decimal places can be extended to an infinite amount of decimal places. This is because pi can be calculated by considering polygons with an increasing number of sides, allowing us to generate as many digits of pi as we like. Additionally, infinity is not always undefined arithmetically and can have many values when considering sets[3]. This was first explored by the Greek geometer Archimedes, who was one of the first to use infinity as a mathematical workhorse[4]. Finally, pi has no exact numerical representation in a finite number of digits in any number/radix system, making it infinite[5]."}
{"answer": "Morning Hands is the synthpop duo of Douglas Du Fresne and Patrick Tabor, based in California[1][2]. They create customised gifts[3] and have performed alongside artists such as Manics, Jayko, Light Echo, Lenny Kiser, POPGANG DJs, WITOWMAKER, PowwowW, Wild Cat, Laughters, and Tenderlions[5]. Morning Hands is not related to the medical condition \"morning hands\", which is described as a type of pain in the hands of some people in the morning, which can be alleviated with heat."}
{"answer": "The public criticism of labor unions may be due to a lack of understanding about the positive effects of unions. Unions provide a voice for workers, advocating for higher wages and better benefits for their members and by mobilizing and building grassroots coalitions, they act as a countervailing force against corporate concentration[1]. They also help workers win benefits such as health insurance from their employers[2]. Despite the positive effects of labor unions, only one in six Americans live in a household with a union member and a majority of non-union workers say they are not interested in joining a union[3]. This may be due to the fact that corporations viewed unions as a threat to their profits since unionized workers use fewer public benefits and could use slowdowns, work stoppages, and strikes to win wage increases, cost-of-living clauses, and better benefits[4]. Research has also found that where workers have union power, states have more equitable economic structures, social structures, and democracies[5]."}
{"answer": "One reason why there is more focus on colonizing Mars than the Moon is because Mars has an atmosphere that is more robust than the Moon's, and may contain a greater abundance of valuable resources such as water[3]. Additionally, there is valuable information that can be learned from setting up a space colony on the Moon which will help inform the colonization plan of Mars[2]. Additionally, colonizing the Moon may help muster the political will to colonize Mars, as people will be able to see the colony directly with their own eyes and understand that colonization is feasible and profitable[4]. Finally, colonizing the Moon may be quicker and easier than colonizing Mars, due to it being harder to monopolize communication between the Earth and Moon than Earth and Mars, which will create a free flow of ideas that will benefit both societies[1]."}
{"answer": "Doctors stop applying a defibrillator after a couple of tries because a defibrillator should not be used on a person who is suffering from a heart attack[4], as it is not an electrical issue, but an issue with clogged arteries and the blood supply not being able to reach the heart. Additionally, during a heart attack, a person is still able to respond and talk to you and tell you where they are experiencing pain, while during cardiac arrest, the person is not responding and may not be breathing[5]. Thus, if the person can talk to you, it is likely a heart attack and defibrillation won't help them.[5]"}
{"answer": "It is possible to program a computer by using machine code, which is a sequence of ones and zeros that the CPU understands[2]. The job of the programmer is to feed the correct bits into the computer's memory, so that they get manipulated by other transistors into the desired result[2]. Programming languages provide a means of bridging the gap between the way our human brains understand the world and the way computer brains (CPUs) understand the world[4]. A program that helps you get lines of code in an application will have this complex logic in place[5]."}
{"answer": "We are able to find planets far away from the Earth because of advances in technology such as the Kepler space telescope, which is able to detect planets around distant stars. However, we don't know if there are other planets in our solar system because the sun is larger and brighter than the Kepler-186 star, meaning that the sun's habitable zone begins farther out from the star by comparison to Kepler-186[2]. To determine whether other planets might be habitable, scientists can use ground-based telescopes to look for clues such as surface liquid, a protective atmosphere, and the correct distance from a star[3]."}
{"answer": "Rooting is a process of possessing the ultimate access on android devices, which allows users to gain administrative (superuser) power to change anything on an android device as per their wish[4]. It can be used to remove preinstalled bloatware and crapware, which are non-essential software or media files bundled with a device to boost revenue and give consumers a chance to try new services[2]. However, rooting can also cause poor performance and void your phone's warranty[5], and can make your device vulnerable to malware if not properly protected by an effective mobile antivirus for Android[5]."}
{"answer": "In the United States, FM radio stations end in odd numbers to avoid interference between stations[1][4][5]. This rule does not hold in other countries, such as Europe[3]. The reason they are odd numbers rather than even numbers is that 1 (odd number) is the first number we start counting from, not 0 (even number)[1]. AM stations do not follow this rule in the US, and there is no reason for this[5]."}
{"answer": "In the context of classical music, repertoire area is referring to a particular style or time period. For example, a repertoire area could be Baroque, Romantic, Classical, or 20th Century music[1]. It is a collection of music pieces played by an individual musician or ensemble, composed for a particular instrument or group of instruments, voice, or choir, or from a particular period or area[3]. Depending on context, it could also mean the complete set of pieces available, such as classical guitar repertoire[4]. A repertoire exam offers candidates the opportunity to present an exam in the form of a recital, featuring repertoire only[5]."}
{"answer": "It is unclear why Mitt Romney will not release his tax returns. Romney has said that Donald Trump must release his tax returns, implying that there is a bombshell in them[2][3]. Additionally, Romney has invited speculation as to what information his earlier tax returns could contain that would be so damaging if it were made public[3]. It appears that Romney is not following a proud bipartisan tradition of presidential nominees displaying genuine financial candor with the electorate[4], and a large majority of the American public is aware of the issues surrounding Romney\u2019s tax returns[5]."}
{"answer": "The main reason is because of a labeling loophole that allows companies to write \"0 trans fat\" on the nutrition facts panel if there is less than 0.5 grams per serving[5]. The manufacturer can jiggle the serving size so that each serving will have less than 0.5 g in the big bags of chips, but small bags of chips are generally considered to contain only 1 serving, and so they can't divide out extra servings to screw with the numbers[3]. Examining the labels of the two bags of chips can also provide insight into other differences, such as additional ingredients to take the place of the missing fats[2]."}
{"answer": "China and India are the two most populous countries in the world, accounting for about 37% of the global population. According to the United Nations\u2019 2019 World Population Prospects report, India is set to overtake China as the most populous country in less than a decade[4], and by 2050, the gap is expected to have widened even further[2]. This is likely due to a combination of factors including India's foreign relations with top economies, the Global Database of Society, and the Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT) Project, which monitors news events in more than 65 languages in near real-time[3]. Additionally, Nigeria is set to be the third most populous country by 2050 with an estimated 733 million people, overtaking the United States[5]."}
{"answer": "Electrical grounding on ships is a complex process as it involves ensuring the safety of both people and equipment. The main task of grounding is to reduce the voltage values which can affect a person[3]. The engineer must select a system that is best fitted in relation to safety, cost and operation[1]. Grounding is not applicable for installations with the voltage below 25 V[4]. Engine, mast and other metal objects for DC circuits cannot be used as ground electrodes[4]. It is also prohibited to combine protective and working grounding with the grounding of lightning protection device[4]. When selecting the grounding method on ship, the primary factor with the selection is the safety of people and secondly the safety of equipment[2][3][5]."}
{"answer": "Kissing is driven by biological and evolutionary factors. Our lips and tongues are packed with nerve endings, which help intensify all those dizzying sensations of being in love when we press our mouths to someone else's[1]. Humans are biologically driven to press their faces together and rub noses or touch lips or tongues[2]. Kissing triggers the release of hormones, such as oxytocin, which helps to trigger the sex drive[3], and helps to boost levels of oxytocin, which also influences social recognition, male and female orgasm, and childbirth, as well as reduce cortisol, the body's main stress hormone[3][4]. It is believed that kissing may have developed as a way to assess genetic compatibility, as well as helping to build emotional bonds between partners."}
{"answer": "The primary difference between general relativity and special relativity is that general relativity pertains to gravity and acceleration, whereas special relativity pertains to speed and time[1][3][4][5]. General relativity describes the relationship between an observer and acceleration, whereas special relativity shows us the relationship between an observer and constant speed[1][3]. Special relativity is applicable if the objects and waves are in the same inertial frame of reference, while general relativity does not have that requirement[5]. Similarly, special relativity assumes a constant speed of light, while general relativity does not[5]. The key difference between special and general relativity is that special relativity ignores the effects of gravity because it has no effect in an inertial reference frame, while general relativity accounts for the effect of gravity on light[5]."}
{"answer": "Border control in the Southern and Northern US works by using a unified approach to improve the Department of Homeland Security's protection of the homeland across both borders. Along the Southern border, this includes operations such as Operation Gatekeeper in San Diego, CA, Operation Hold the Line in El Paso, TX, Operation Rio Grande in McAllen, TX, Operation Safeguard in Tucson, AZ, and the Arizona Border Control Initiative (ABCI) along the Arizona border[2]. The greatest number of apprehensions have occurred along the easternmost part of the border, called the Rio Grande Valley sector, in Texas, however, the Trump administration built fewer new border barriers in that sector than in any other[3]. Safeguarding the Southern U.S. border is the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)[4], and is accomplished by the Border Patrol, which is responsible for patrolling nearly 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and over 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico[5]."}
{"answer": "Big trucks have large, convex hubcaps and lugnuts on the front wheels because the wheel needs to bulge outwards to accommodate the steering and brakes components[2][5]. This design also helps to achieve a balanced weight distribution for reliable stability while driving[3]. The truck rear wheels are concave to make room for the pair of wheels to be supported on the same hub[4][5]. This design helps to cut the overall cost of building and maintaining the trucks and their trailers[5]."}
{"answer": "The GED is the \"General Educational Development\" test, which is a series of tests designed to show that a person has high-school level academic skills, and if passed, the person is awarded with a Certificate of High School Equivalency[3]. People make fun of those who take the test because they have already proven themselves failures by societal standards just having to take the test[1]. It can also be a way for someone to make themselves feel better about their own situation[2]. To help stay motivated, it is important to surround yourself with positive people who will support you through the process."}
{"answer": "The exact size of the Internet is very difficult to determine, but based on extrapolations for the coming years, the size of the Internet in 2012 was estimated to be 2800 Zettabytes or 2.8 exabytes (2.8 billion terabytes)[1]. Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google, estimated the size of the Internet at roughly 5 million terabytes of data[1][2]. The size of the Internet can also be measured in terms of the number of people who use it, the number of websites, bytes of data contained, distinct servers operating, and amount of traffic running through it per second[1][3]. According to Russel Seitz, the best way to conceive of something as inconceivable as the size of the Internet is to estimate the weight of the energy used to move a byte of information around, which is two ounces[4]. The Internet's size is a moving target and is growing by leaps and bounds, but the saving grace is that our computing capacity is growing even faster than the amount of data we store[5]."}
{"answer": "Artificial flavoring is a safe and edible chemical composition that is created synthetically in the lab to have the same taste and smell as natural flavorings, only without being extracted from natural sources[2]. Most artificial flavors are specific and often complex mixtures of singular naturally occurring flavor compounds combined to either imitate or enhance a natural flavor[1][3]. These mixtures are formulated by flavorists to give a food product a unique flavor and to maintain flavor consistency between different product batches or after recipe changes. The list of known flavoring agents includes thousands of molecular compounds, and the flavor chemist (flavorist) can often mix these together to produce many of the common flavors, such as grape or other fruits[1][3]. Artificial flavoring is exactly the opposite of natural flavoring in that the taste is created in a lab via a chemical process[2][5]."}
{"answer": "Wells can be built in various ways, depending on the intended use and local geology. A dug well is built by excavating a hole into a water-bearing zone, lowering a casing into the aquifer, and constructing the seal[1]. The other methods include driving, drilling and percussion machines, which are able to drill thousands of feet deep and require the installation of a casing[3][4]. In highly developed countries like the U.S., specific regulations are in place to prevent problems such as pollution and contaminants[5]."}
{"answer": "The size of raindrops depends on the process of formation. In principle, condensation of moist air at high altitudes causes tiny drops to form. As soon as those drops get big enough, they start to fall. If they encounter other little drops on their way down, they will \"eat\" the little drops and get even bigger[2]. Another factor is that if a raindrop is bigger, it will fall faster, which means it will be flattened more by the surrounding air[3]. On the other side of the size spectrum, we have drizzle rain, which stay small because their distance to each other doesn't grow much and the wind keeps them more or less the same[4]. According to research, the shape of the raindrop also changes due to topological changes as they fall, which can eventually cause them to explode into a chaotic shower of smaller drops of various sizes[5]. The size of raindrops is not indicative of how much longer the rain will fall, as rainfall intensity is more-so based on how much rain falls within a certain time[1]."}
{"answer": "Space agencies take many precautions to ensure they are not contaminating Mars/The Moon. They use a technique called \"trajectory biasing\" to ensure the craft is initially aimed on a trajectory that would miss Mars, and they transport the spacecraft to the launchpad sealed inside the fairing of the rocket that lifts it into orbit[2]. They also employ a planetary protection protocol, which classifies missions based on the threat of contamination they pose, from Category I on the low end to Category V on the high end[4]. Additionally, astronauts are working carefully to ensure that they don't contaminate other worlds while they search for signs of life[5]. They care because they want to protect any potential life on Mars and other worlds from Earth-based contamination.[3]"}
{"answer": "We are not concerned with bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms developing resistance to alcohol, chlorine, and other substances used to sterilize medical equipment (and hands) because these substances have a broad and strong antimicrobial activity. For example, alcohol has a broad and strong virucidal activity and is effective against the majority of clinically relevant viruses. In addition, sterilizers have the strongest type of public health antimicrobial activity and are used when the presence of microbes must be prevented as much as possible[5]. Although some bacteria are becoming more tolerant of alcohol-based hand sanitizers[1][2][3], they are not yet resistant to it.[3][4]"}
{"answer": "Death is a natural process that marks the moment when your vital organs stop working to keep you alive[1][2][4]. It is a series of events where your body slowly shuts down and is no longer capable of carrying on the ongoing processes of living. The exact experience of dying can vary from person to person, and there is no straightforward answer as to what it will feel like[4]. According to major Eastern religions, there is something about you that survives the death of your body and finds another body to go live in[5]."}
{"answer": "The idea of \"seeing the light\" when passing away originated from people's experiences and beliefs in the afterlife. People who have been close to someone \"crossing over\" have reported that they often reach up towards the heavens and make mention of seeing something, usually interpreted as the Light of God. Nurses who have cared for the dying, and have heard people say they can't wait to leave, believe there is more beyond this life[2][3]. From the stories of these experiences, people began to believe that there is a light after death, and that by believing in it one can see it[4]. Examples of people who have seen the light include a man whose distressing illness was instantly healed after he crossed into the light[5]."}
{"answer": "Brainwaves are electrical signals that are generated by the neurons in the brain. They are measured in hertz (Hz) and can be divided into five categories: delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), beta (13-38Hz), and gamma (39-42Hz). Binaural beats are a type of sound wave that can influence the brain's brainwaves. This is achieved by playing two slightly different tones into each ear[1][4]. This causes the brain to interpret the sound waves as one tone with the difference in frequencies from each ear[4]. This can be used to produce specific, desired types of brainwaves, with the most common goal being to produce alpha waves, as they are linked to feelings of relaxation[4]. Additionally, soundwaves can be used to stimulate the brain and produce neurotransmitters, such as serotonin[2][4]."}
{"answer": "A Markov chain is a stochastic model that outlines the probability associated with a sequence of events occurring based on the state in the previous event[2][3][4][5]. It is important because it has the Markov property, which states that the probability of future actions are not dependent upon the steps that led up to the present state[3][5]. This property makes it a powerful and effective tool for modeling a discrete-time and space stochastic process[1] and it can be used for many tasks such as text generation[4]."}
{"answer": "The Holocaust is so much more popular than other historical genocides because it is strongly embedded in our collective memory, and there is a greater availability of research and witness accounts about it[1]. Furthermore, it is possible to sharpen understandings of the similarities and differences between the Holocaust and other genocides[1][2][3] and to better understand the particular historical significance of the Holocaust[3]. Additionally, the Holocaust can be related to other genocides for reasons such as the national history of a given country[1][4]."}
{"answer": "There are several reasons why your stationary leg may hurt when you ride a skateboard. These include tendonitis, muscle sprains from over-skating, wrong skating technique, weak shin, calf muscle, or ill-fitting skateboarding shoes[1], repeated, forceful motions which can cause painful foot and heel conditions such as plantar fasciitis, bone spurs, fractures, and Achilles tendonitis[3], and tendonitis and sprains in the feet, ankles, and knees due to overuse and pressure placed on the feet while skateboarding[5]."}
{"answer": "The significance of the MPAA joining the W3C is that it has the potential to help influence the future of digital rights policy and standards for web browsers[1]. The MPAA's joining of the W3C also comes at a time when the film industry has started to figure out a successful way to drive digital movie sales[3]. As a member of the W3C, the MPAA will be able to shape the standards that govern the internet, such as the HTML technology that underlies every Web page[4]."}
{"answer": "Electricity doesn't actually \"want\" to be grounded. It only goes into the ground if there is an excess in charge[2]. The Earth is like a gigantic battery that contains a natural, subtle electrical charge[3][5]. This charge is referred to as electric potential energy[5]. Ground is defined as voltage=0, so a circuit being grounded is like minimizing its electrical potential energy[5]. Therefore, electricity will naturally move to a ground point to minimize its electrical potential energy. If there was a bigger planet, electricity would still be drawn to it if it had a lower electrical potential energy than its current environment."}
{"answer": "In the event of a corporate bankruptcy, the unpaid bills are usually footed by the company's creditors. Depending on the circumstances, a court may pierce the corporate veil and hold the owners personally liable for their company's business debts[2]. The company's debt is prioritized in the bankruptcy process, with preferred creditors and secured debts paid first[5]. The federal bankruptcy laws govern how companies go out of business or recover from crippling debt, and the company may use Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to reorganize its business and try to become profitable again[4]."}
{"answer": "Bushfires can be caused by both natural and human causes. Natural causes include lightning strikes that ignite dry plants and trees[2], while human causes include not extinguishing campfires properly, deliberate setting of fires and smouldering fires that suddenly flare up with hot and windy conditions. Unfortunately, most bushfires are started by humans, either on purpose or accidentally[5]."}
{"answer": "Food companies determine the expiration date of a product based on a variety of factors, such as the characteristics of the food, its packaging, and the temperature at which it will be stored[1][2]. They may also use mathematical models based on microbial challenge studies to predict food expiry dates[2]. Regulations regarding the production and sale of food usually require either a best before date or a use by date to be labelled on each product[3]. Smaller companies may list a date on their product based on the length of shelf life they have estimated their competitors are using, or they may use reference materials or ask food safety experts for advice on the date to list on their product[5]."}
{"answer": "Generally, the voices from the apartment above are easier to hear because sound travels more easily upwards than downwards[4]. This is because of the outdated architecture and infrastructure of the building, which is usually composed of wood that conducts sound better than cement or metal. Additionally, loud noises can easily travel to units on the same floor[4], and the sound of pattering feet running around can be loud and annoying to your neighbors[5]."}
{"answer": "No, you should not take any antibacterial medicine for any bacterial infection. You should consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking any antibiotics, as certain antibiotics may interact with other medications or herbal remedies. Additionally, if you have had an allergic reaction to an antibiotic in the past, you should not take that type of antibiotic again[2][4]. It is also important to follow the directions on the label and read the patient information leaflet that comes with your antibiotic[5]."}
{"answer": "Rumble strips are rows of raised markers that can be placed in the roadway to create noise and vibration when the tyres of a vehicle make contact[2]. These are intended to alert drivers that there is some form of change in the roadway they need to be aware of[2]. Milled-in rumble strips ground into the pavement are preferred over rolled-in rumble strips[3], as they produce a vibration level 12 times greater than rolled strips[3]. There are multiple types of rumble strips, and their uses vary depending on the installed location[5]."}
{"answer": "The U.S. military uses exciting action commercials and other fanfare for recruiting because they want to make the organization attractive to potential recruits, and to make their service appear distinct and unique. The commercials also emphasize personal development and don't portray an unrealistic image of military service, which helps close the gap between the military and civilians[2]. Additionally, the commercials play on human weaknesses and are part of a bigger marketing and public relations strategy to attract enlistees and create a positive image of service in society[3]. Historically, the military has used posters and newspaper ads to play on patriotism and a desire for revenge[4], and even in modern times they avoid mentioning the possible dangers involved in service[5]."}
{"answer": "The ultimate drive for survival is the need to reproduce and pass on the genes of the species to the next generation[3]. This is true for all living things, and is the root of all living things as the first living life form must have wanted to exist and adapted in order to survive[4]. We want to survive because there are things we want to experience and do in life, and we want to become happy[1]. However, even though many of us strive to thrive, the majority of us are still just surviving[5]."}
{"answer": "During an autopsy, a coroner will typically order a post-mortem examination to determine the cause of death, identify the remains, document injuries, and to assist in determining the manner of death[2]. Establishing the identity of the deceased is of paramount importance[3], and to identify a body, a death investigator will ask the person making the identification questions about themselves and how they know the deceased[4]. The Coroner's Liaison Officer will contact the family as soon as the preliminary results are available and will advise the family on the findings[5]."}
{"answer": "After burning your tongue from hot food, it is important to immediately relieve the pain by consuming something cold, such as an ice cube or a frozen Popsicle, and coating your tongue with something soothing, such as milk[1]. Pain medications, such as over-the-counter NSAIDs, can help reduce pain and inflammation[2]. It is also important to drink cold water to regulate the tongue's irritation, as well as to stay away from hot foods and drinks until the burn heals[3]. Lastly, the cells in your taste buds regenerate every one to two weeks, so your taste should return to normal within a week or so[5]."}
{"answer": "A dark oven interior helps to create more heat around the cooking vessel than a shiny interior, as the dark color absorbs the heat energy and the heat is then conducted and radiated to the vessel/food[2]. The dark color also helps to absorb more of the heat energy of the sun's rays, making the oven more efficient in transferring the heat to the cooking vessel[2][3]. On the other hand, a shiny interior only sends or reflects the rays to the dark pot which then absorbs the heat energy[2]."}
{"answer": "The reason why water tastes bitter after eating pineapples is because pineapples contain an enzyme called bromelain[4]. This enzyme breaks down proteins in flesh, which is why it is used to tenderize meat. When the enzyme in your gums meets the enzyme in the fruit itself, they react to each other and form a slightly bitter taste[5]."}
{"answer": "The shape of a tree's leaves is determined by its function and by its environment[1]. Leaves are adapted to cope with different environmental conditions, such as temperature, water loss, and light[3][5]. Sun leaves are usually smaller with less surface area to protect them from water loss, while shade leaves need more surface area to conduct photosynthesis effectively[5]. Also, some plants change the shape of their leaves over time and space to better adapt to their environment[4]."}
{"answer": "Refined and processed foods with high amounts of added sugar have had all their fiber and essential nutrients taken away and are composed of simple sugars that have simple chemical structures, making them easily and quickly utilized for energy by the body, often leading to a faster rise in blood sugar and insulin secretion from the pancreas[2]. This can lead to insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes type 2, and cardiovascular disease[3], as well as being implicated in weight gain and metabolic diseases[4]. In addition, sugar is a term that includes all sweet carbohydrates, and the body breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars such as glucose[5]. This is why sugar is considered to be the unhealthiest carb."}
{"answer": "The reason why things like the Westboro Baptist Church and the such do not get arrested for hate speech is because of freedom of speech laws. In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Westboro Baptist Church's right to protest at funerals, arguing that even hateful speech, when addressing matters of pubic import on public property, should be protected[1][2]. Additionally, some people believe that silencing their websites will only encourage others to believe that they are being persecuted, and may actually bring them more supporters[5]."}
{"answer": "Glaciers and ice caps are made of freshwater, not frozen salt water[1][2][3]. This is because freshwater freezes at a higher temperature than saltwater[1], and ice that forms from freezing seawater typically freezes slowly enough that it forms crystalline water (ice), which does not have room for salt inclusions[4]. Icebergs are pieces of glaciers, formed of compacted snowfall, and are therefore fresh water[1][3]. Even though icebergs and floes float in saltwater, they don\u2019t get contaminated by the salt because the ice is a giant water crystal[5]."}
{"answer": "The vast majority of 8-bit (and some 16-bit) video games use the same font because the 8-bit and 16-bit consoles used 8-bit and 16-bit processors respectively, which affects the quality and variety in the graphics and the music by affecting how much data can be stored[4]. This means that games must use different fonts for different code pages to support multiple languages[3]. Additionally, while the 8-bit and 16-bit consoles may not be 100% exactly 8-bit or 16-bit[1][4], they are defined terms in popular culture and will remain that way for history[1]."}
{"answer": "The purpose of sharps and flats in the chromatic scale is to allow every version of the diatonic scale to start at any point on the chromatic scale without repeating a note letter name, or assigning different notes in our chosen diatonic scale to the same line on the musical stave[1]. This rule is also used when playing a chromatic scale fragment only and not necessarily the whole chromatic scale[2]. The use of sharps or flats is closely related to how music works, particularly the modern musical system called the \u2018tonal system\u2019[3]. In the example of the chromatic scale below, notice that it is notated using sharps when it is ascending, but when it is descending the sharped notes are replaced with their enharmonic equivalents so that only flats are used. This is a common convention for notating chromatic scales[4]. Also, remember how the chromatic scale works: use the sharps going up and the flats going down[5]."}
{"answer": "Brightness and staring too much at a screen can produce eye fatigue and headaches because the brain has to direct the eye muscles to constantly readjust focus between the RPA and the front of the screen, which can lead to eye strain and eye fatigue[1]. Spending too many hours staring at a screen can cause eye strain because you tend to blink less and the movement of the screen makes your eyes work harder to focus[2]. Poor posture and excessive brightness or over-illumination can also trigger headaches[3][4]. Focusing fatigue can also cause computer eye strain, and to reduce the risk of tiring your eyes it is recommended to look away from the computer at least every 20 minutes and gaze at a distant object for at least 20 seconds[5]."}
{"answer": "Tourette Syndrome (TS or Tourette's) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in childhood or adolescence[1][3]. It is characterized by multiple movement (motor) tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic[1][4]. These tics often go unnoticed by casual observers[1]. The tics are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles known as a premonitory urge, can sometimes be suppressed temporarily, and characteristically change in location, strength, and frequency[1]. It often occurs in children between the ages of 2 and 15[3] and is one of a group of disorders of the developing nervous system called tic disorders[5]."}
{"answer": "The Bible is composed of two sections: the Old Testament, which contains a collection of writings compiled and preserved as the sacred books of the ancient Hebrew people, and the New Testament, which chronicles the origin and early dissemination of Christianity[3][4]. The modern Protestant Bible typically contains 66 books and has undergone changes over the centuries, including the publication of the King James Bible in 1611 and the addition of several books that were discovered later[1][2]. The Old Testament is considered to be a very important part of Christianity, as it provides a profoundly theological interpretation of the universe and human existence and is a major factor in the preservation of the Jews as a cultural entity and Judaism as a religion[3][4]. Despite popular belief, modern historical study has not been able to refute the historical accuracy and uniqueness of the Bible, and it is still possible to intelligently believe the Bible is God\u2019s Word and that the God of the Bible exists[5]."}
{"answer": "Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer separate from the actual hardware[4]. It is realized with the help of software \u2013 a hypervisor[3][4]. A hypervisor provides the ability to separate the machine's resources - such as CPU, memory, storage and more - from the hardware and distribute them appropriately[4]. It also allows you to split that one system into completely separate, distinct and secure environments called virtual machines[4]. Virtualization lets you carve up resources within a physical machine to run separate instances within the same machine[5], which allows you to maximize capacity on a physical machine and reduce the number of machines you need[4][5]."}
{"answer": "The reflexes that cause your eyes to close before you can process what happened are part of the ocular reflexes, which are protective reflexes that compensate for the condition of the cornea and for changes in the visual stimulus[2]. In particular, the blink reflex protects the cornea from drying out and from contact with foreign objects[2]. The blink response causes the eyelid to close and this system works together with a secondary circuit pathway through the oculomotor nucleus to re-open the eyelid[5]. This secondary pathway is activated by the same touch pathway used by the blink response (Trigeminal V1)[5]."}
{"answer": "A GPS unit requires signal from at least 4 satellites in order to determine its position because it needs information from at least 4 satellites to work out its position in 3-dimensions[1]. The GPS receiver determines its own location by measuring the time it takes for a signal to arrive at its location from at least four satellites[3][5]. The satellites transmit the exact time the signals are sent, so given the travel time of the GPS signals from three satellites and their exact position in the sky, the GPS receiver can determine the position in three dimensions[4][5]. Additionally, the GPS system needs to have incredibly precise clocks on the satellites and receivers, and must be able to access and interpret the signals from several orbiting satellites simultaneously[5]."}
{"answer": "Different types of crabs have different methods for breathing in both environments. Aquatic crabs have gills like fish and can go out of water for short periods of time[2]. Terrestrial crabs have lungs and can hold a bubble of air in front of their face[2]. Intertidal crabs have gills and also have cuticles on their legs that help them breathe on land[2]. Land crabs are unable to breathe underwater, but they can hold their breaths when they get submerged[2][4]. Finally, some species of crabs have specialized organs that allow them to breathe in both land and water[2]."}
{"answer": "Flies and other insects are capable of learning, but they often go into dangerous situations, such as the exact same spot after being swatted at, because they are looking for a food source. The reason they are able to outmaneuver swats from humans has a lot to do with their speed and the structure of their eyes[2]. Flies have compound eyes, which allow them to see all around them without having any blind spots and to fly away from danger within 100 milliseconds[3]. They can also rely on nonvisual cues, such as small hairs on their body that detect changes in the air currents when the human moves to swat them[4][5]."}
{"answer": "Ticket scalping is the act of buying tickets in an automated manner, using bots (scalper bots) to later resell them for an increased price[1]. Scalpers (or ticket touts in British English) then work outside events, often showing up with unsold tickets from brokers' offices on a consignment basis or buying extra tickets from fans at or below face value on a speculative basis hoping to resell them at a profit[2]. Scalping tickets refers to the advance purchase and resale of tickets once an event has sold out[3]. Scalpers use so-called \u201cscalper bots\u201d to buy as many tickets as possible for certain events on certain dates[4]. The tickets are then sold at a higher price to make up for the initial cost, which can go as high as 1,200%[4]. There is an argument that ticket scalping actually enhances the total welfare of concert goers and sports fans by distributing tickets to those who value them the most[5]."}
{"answer": "Antimatter is a material composed of so-called antiparticles. It is believed that every particle we know of has an antimatter companion that is virtually identical to itself, but with the opposite charge[2]. Antimatter is composed of subatomic particles that have the mass, electric charge, and magnetic moment of the electrons, protons, and neutrons of ordinary matter but for which the electric charge and magnetic moment are opposite in sign[3]. Matter and antimatter cannot coexist at close range for more than a small fraction of a second because they collide with and annihilate each other, releasing large quantities of energy in the form of gamma rays or elementary particles[3]. Antimatter can be artificially created in particle accelerators[4], and experiments have successfully been able to bind together antimatter particles to form antiatoms[4]. Other groups of physicists are researching to see if the properties of antimatter really are the mirror of their matter partners[3][5]."}
{"answer": "The main difference between Meth and Adderall is that meth is more potent than Adderall. Specifically, methamphetamine is more potent than amphetamine, which is one of the main ingredients in Adderall[1]. This chemical difference makes it easier and faster for meth to enter the brain than Adderall[1][2][5]. Meth can produce an increased sense of euphoria, confidence, and alertness in its purest form, giving it a higher potential for abuse and addiction than Adderall when comparing speed and ice[1]. In addition, street meth is typically mixed with cutting agents and other impurities, while Desoxyn and Adderall are not[2]. Meth can cause much more intense stimulating effects than Adderall[5]. When you smoke meth, large amounts can reach the brain quickly, leading to a powerful high within minutes, while Adderall can take 20 to 30 minutes to take effect[5]."}
{"answer": "Physical tests cannot be used to detect mental illness because there are no medical tests that can diagnose mental health disorders[1]. Screening tests can be used to look for signs of common mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression[2][3], but they cannot diagnose them[2]. The best way to determine whether physical symptoms are related to physical issues or mental health issues is to meet with a primary care physician, who can help run tests or blood work to help determine if there is a physical reason for the symptoms[4]. Additionally, mental illness can cause physical illness, but some doctors may not believe or understand this, or might use a person's mental state to dismiss their physical symptoms[5]."}
{"answer": "Japan has a small market for records by popular western artists which means that the records are pressed in smaller batches, with much more diligence and higher standards, and using brand-new vinyl for every pressing which creates a much cleaner sound[2]. Also, Japanese labels often offer extra tracks not available on the 'standard' edition, as well as glossy posters, booklets, specially written liner notes and song lyrics written in Japanese[4]. In addition, Japan's manga market is enormously larger than the North American and French markets[5], and manga is a very important part of daily life in Japan. These are some of the reasons why there are so many special edition albums, games, mangas, electronics, gadgets released only in Japan."}
{"answer": "The main reason why games for consoles lack mod support that their PC versions have is because consoles are a closed platform with games that still have issues running to their full potential[3]. Mod support on consoles would be a great burden for developers, as it would require them to sacrifice things on the PC side and potentially lock out Steam Workshop[3]. Additionally, the majority of games on console have issues maintaining performance compared to their PC counterparts and adding on mods would just bog things down further[5]."}
{"answer": "According to research, the ability to make caffeine evolved at least twice, in the ancestor of coffee plants and in a common ancestor of tea and cacao[4][5]. Coffee uses a completely different set of genes than tea does to bring about the same awesome buzz[1], which suggests that coffee and tea evolved independently.[1][2][4][5]"}
{"answer": "It is theoretically possible to convert charge from lightning rods to usable electricity, but it would require complex capture and storage facilities, distribution systems, tall metallic rods, and robust safety mechanisms[1]. Additionally, due to the efficiency of the process, it would only power about 0.1 percent of the world\u2019s homes[4][5]. Therefore, due to the complexity and inefficiency of the process, it is not currently practical to do so.[4][5]"}
{"answer": "Flossing is an important oral hygiene habit that helps to clean and dislodge food stuck between teeth and reduce the amount of bacteria and plaque in your mouth[1]. It is recommended to floss once per day before or after brushing[3]. Floss is commonly supplied in plastic dispensers that contain 10 to 100 meters of floss. After pulling out approximately 40 cm of floss, the user strings the piece of floss on a fork-like instrument or holds it between their fingers using both hands with about 1\u20132 cm of floss exposed[3]. Flossing helps lift and release food and plaque stuck in between your teeth, while brushing removes these particles from your mouth[1][3][5]. Super Flosses are a type of dental floss threader that can work with braces, bridges, and gaps[2]. It is claimed that up to 80% of plaque can be removed by flossing, and it may confer a particular benefit in individuals with orthodontic devices[4]."}
{"answer": "It is easier to doze off during the day after work or class because your body's production of melatonin, which helps you sleep, is influenced by light and dark[2]. During the day, the light helps to make your body more energized and alert, and the darkness associated with night-time can make it easier to fall asleep. Establishing a routine, such as an order of activities at bedtime, can help a person fall asleep, as well as changing the temperature or lighting in a bedroom[3]. Developing a relaxing bedtime routine to prepare your mind and body for sleep, such as taking a warm bath, reading, or listening to soothing music, and avoiding screens at least one hour before bedtime can help as well[4]. Additionally, avoiding drinking alcohol late at night can help improve your sleep cycles."}
{"answer": "When someone wins a new home from a television show such as HGTV's \"My Lottery Dream Home\" or \"Home to Win\", they typically don't know they've won until they are surprised with an \"ambush\" announcement. The winner will usually receive the associated prizes like the vehicles, cash, and furnishings, but HGTV retains the rights to the house and usually sells it to a private bidder[4]. However, the show is often scripted, edited, and directed to make the end result look believable, interesting, and marketable[5]."}
{"answer": "Prisms split apart the different colors of light because each color is characteristic of a distinct wave frequency and different frequencies of light waves bend varying amounts upon passage through a prism[1][4]. This is why when you shine a flashlight in a prism, the different colors get separated and you get a rainbow[1][4]. However, lenses don't disperse light as efficiently because convex lenses disperse light like prisms and that effect is known as chromatic aberration[2]. However, it is much less efficient than a prism because it is difficult to project an spectrum using a pair of common eyeglasses, a magnifier or even a photography objective[5]."}
{"answer": "Mountains are typically triangular in shape due to natural erosion[1][4]. This is because mountains were created in a primordial environment[5], where winds coming from a single direction caused the mountain to be shaped in a conical form in a 3D view, which appears triangular in a 2D view. This explains why many mountains have a steeper side (the windward side) and a shallow, flat side, which displays the triangular features[5]. This is why volcanoes, which were formed by eruption and not winds, do not display triangular features, and why water erodes channels straight down their slopes like it is supposed to[5]."}
{"answer": "Donuts are considered a breakfast food because they can be delicious and satisfying[2][5], and they have their place in the world of breakfast foods[2]. However, they are usually limited to a snack or dessert because they are too sweet for breakfast[1]. Additionally, donuts should only be consumed once in a while for breakfast because they have a lot of sugar[5]."}
{"answer": "Detox water can be beneficial for your health as it can help with hydration, digestion, and can replace sugary high-calorie beverages with a naturally healthy alternative[3]. Additionally, detox water can help to extract the nutritive benefits and health properties from the fruits and vegetables which are added to the water[2]. Drinking detox water can also help to improve your gut health, as the fiber in the fruits and vegetables can help with digestion[5]. Therefore, drinking detox water in addition to having a normal diet of fruits and vegetables can be beneficial for your health."}
{"answer": "A tune-up on a car typically consists of an engine inspection and adjustments to mechanical parts such as the carburetor, distributor, and timing belt[1]. Additionally, it might include a complete check of the vehicle's systems, such as brakes, tires, an oil change, or an A/C recharge[2]. Nowadays, the term \"tune-up\" is used incorrectly to describe any kind of routine car maintenance[3]. However, a true tune-up is made up of an inspection and the actual tune up[1][4][5]. The inspection includes a visual check of the engine's fuel-system components to ensure that the fuel filter is clean and unclogged, that no damage has been caused to the fuel pump, and that fuel injector is also clean.[5]"}
{"answer": "Drone attacks have become increasingly controversial in recent years, with the US using them to target people suspected of being involved in terrorism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen and other countries, violating international humanitarian law and often resulting in civilian deaths[1]. The victims of these drone attacks have been heard in court for the first time by a lawsuit filed by Faisal, Ahmed Saeed, and Khaled Mohmed bin Ali Jaber, who are contributing to the long overdue political debate on Germany\u2019s role in US drone strikes[2]. The lawsuit was prepared by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) and British NGO Reprieve in October 2014[3]. On March 13, 2019, an administrative appeals court in Northern Germany will review a legal challenge filed by a Somali herdsman whose innocent father was killed in a U.S. drone strike[5]."}
{"answer": "Student loan jargon can be confusing to understand. Student debt refers to loans taken out to pay for college tuition that are due after the student graduates or leaves school[1]. College financial aid letters can be misleading and confusing and can have real consequences, like extra debt or even quitting school[2]. Student loan debt in the United States has grown significantly in recent years, and is now one of the largest forms of consumer borrowing in the country[3]. To borrow money for college, a student loan is an option, where you'll need to repay the principal with interest[4]. Be careful when taking out student loans, as it is easy to get confused since some of the lenders that offer private student loans also service federal student loans on behalf of the U.S. government[5]. That's why it's important to understand the different types of loans and how student loans work.[4][5]"}
{"answer": "Cops wear oxford shoes rather than running/sports shoes because they need a highly polished, traditional dress shoe for certain occasions such as promotion ceremonies or protection details for dignitaries. Additionally, tennis shoes don't hold up to everyday use as well as a good pair of leather shoes and are not as water repellent[5]. Furthermore, oxford shoes have stiffer soles for more support and may have metal shanks to prevent punctures from nails, etc. Finally, dress-style shoes look better with a uniform[5]."}
{"answer": "Yes, the Wi-Fi owner can see all the websites you visit when you are connected to his Wi-Fi network[1]. They might also be able to monitor what you do online if they have physical access to your device[3]. If someone is the administrator of the Wi-Fi network, they have the right to track your internet activity[3][5]. So, if you don't want to risk your personal or financial information being accessed, it is highly recommended that you install a VPN on your device and hide your browsing history from Wi-Fi admins."}
{"answer": "Telecom companies are allowed to be regional monopolies without antitrust lawsuits and being broken up ala Bell because of the 1984 divestiture of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company\u2019s (AT&T) local telephone business, which created a system of regional service monopolies (variously called \u201cRegional Bell Operating Companies,\u201d \u201cBaby Bells,\u201d or \u201cIncumbent Local Exchange Carriers\u201d (ILECs)) and a separate, competitive market for long-distance service from which the ILECs were excluded[1][3]. This was supported by the 1956 consent decree against the Bell System, which settled a seven-year old antitrust lawsuit that sought to break up the Bell System[2]. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 withdrew approval of the ILECs\u2019 monopolies, \u201cfundamentally restructur[ing] local telephone markets\u201d and \u201csubject[ing] [ILECs] to a host of duties intended to facilitate market entry\u201d[1][3]. It also authorized them to enter the long-distance market and obliged them to share their networks with competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs)[3]. The shift also gave rise to many local providers, which eventually merged into larger, more powerful regional providers and finally into once-again national networks, albeit controlled by several major players rather than just one[4]. Moreover, since the ILECs were born in a traditionally unregulated industry with low barriers to entry and sparse competition among large firms dominating separate geographical segments of the market[5], it is likely that the former Government-sanctioned monopolists were sitting tight, expecting their neighbors to do the same thing.[5]"}
{"answer": "The ends of your fingers can hurt after you cut your fingernails too short because the skin under your nail has lots of nerve endings in it, which are not used to being touched as they are usually covered by the nail[5]. When you cut the nail too short, this exposes the nerve endings to pressure and can cause pain[1][4][5]. If the pain and tenderness linger for days and is accompanied by swelling, pus, or redness, it is likely that you have a nail infection[2]."}
{"answer": "The value of following orders in the military is important for ensuring the cohesive strength of a unit, but the Nuremberg Defense is widely criticized for attempting to let people off the hook for simply following orders[2]. According to Nuremberg Principle IV, \"defense of superior orders\" is not a defense for war crimes[3][4], although it can be a mitigating factor that could influence a sentencing authority to lessen the penalty. The Nuremberg defense is considered to be invalid because, although soldiers are trained to follow orders without questioning them, the orders were so heinous that any reasonable person should have questioned them[5]."}
{"answer": "Steakhouse restaurants cook a lot of steaks at the same time to varying degrees of done-ness by using a quality product from a quality purveyor and allowing the steaks to come up to room temperature before cooking them on the char grill with the right amount of seasoning, to get a great char on the outside[3]. They also use timing to ensure the steaks are cooked correctly, noting which steak is which, substituting one steak for an order for another, and communicating with all the other cooks[4]. Additionally, they flip the steak multiple times\u2014as often as once every 15 seconds or so\u2014to not only end up with meat that's more evenly cooked, but also to cut down on cook time and develop a great crust on top of that[5]."}
{"answer": "No, OJ cannot be prosecuted for the murders even if the recently discovered knife is linked to him, as the double jeopardy clause of the US constitution prevents Mr Simpson from prosecution[2]. Even if the knife is from O.J. Simpson's former property and implicates him in the killings[4], he cannot be brought forth on murder charges stemming from this development[4]."}
{"answer": "Porting a PS2 game like Metal Gear Solid 2 to Xbox 360/PS3 for an HD Collection involves the work of multiple development teams. Bluepoint Games was responsible for porting Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3, with assistance from Armature Studio for the PS Vita and NVIDIA Shield TV versions[2]. Genki worked on porting Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker[2][5]. Aspect Co. reworked the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, which were included in MGS3 previously[5]."}
{"answer": "The water spray from the shower can feel cold when you're standing next to the beam itself even if the water is warm because the cocoon behind the curtain traps a lot of water vapor, keeping the air in the shower moist and warm, while the air outside the curtain is not as humid[1]. This causes warm water to evaporate faster, making the bathroom feel like an icebox when you step out[1]. Also, when you're in the shower you're feeling heat transferred to your body from the warm water, and also transferred away from your body when it evaporates[3]. In some cases, the temperature knobs may have been inverted, meaning when it is turned towards the \u201cH\u201d, you get cold water instead of hot water[4]. Additionally, when you have the cap turned all the way up to a full blast that's hot, the smallest droplets that you feel may still be cold because the water pressure is too low[5]."}
{"answer": "The majority of films that have action scenes usually have the action extremely loud and have all the talking quiet because it makes the big things look bigger when compared to the quiet moments. It also allows the directors and sound engineers to use the headroom, or volume left, to make noises, effects and music that they want to stand out be really impactful and louder than everything else[2]. This contrast and surprise from things being quiet to being suddenly loud is also thrilling for humans[2]. Additionally, movies are mixed for surround sound and for movie theaters, where having high dynamic range in volume between quieter things like dialogue and loud things like explosions and specific music scores makes things much more impactful and emotional[2]. Finally, this is generally not a problem in commercial cinemas, which have high-quality sound systems and good acoustics, but when it comes to home viewing, most people are using weak TV speakers in a less-than-ideal room with the air conditioner running in the background, which can make dialogue unintelligible and require constant volume tweaking[5]."}
{"answer": "It is possible to negotiate with a lender to repay a debt after it has been sent to collections[3]. You may be able to get a more reasonable payment option, reduce the balance on your original loan or even stop interest from accruing on the loan balance altogether[3]. You may also be able to ask the collection agency or creditor to take the collection off your credit report out of goodwill, if the debt was acquired under unfortunate circumstances and the debt has been paid[4]. Creditors may also wait until you have missed at least four monthly payments before they contract with outside agencies to handle collections or sell the rights to the debt entirely[5]."}
{"answer": "A trust fund is a legal entity that provides financial, tax, and legal protections for individuals[2]. It is an agreement where a person or group of people have control over assets or cash on someone else\u2019s behalf[3]. A trust fund is managed by a trustee, who is named when the trust is created, and can contain money, bank accounts, property, stocks, businesses, heirlooms, and any other investment types[5]. The assets remain in the trust until certain circumstances are met, at which point they will be distributed to the beneficiaries[5]."}
{"answer": "Scientists speculate that certain \"noises\" such as a fingernail scratching a chalkboard irritate us so much because the frequency of the sound is a perfect match with the middle frequencies of a scream[3]. This triggers the same alarm bells in our heads as a scream, even though our visual cues tell us that nothing threatening is happening around us[3]. This theory is supported by a study conducted in 2012, where people ranked a list of sounds according to how annoying they were, and the sounds that made it to the top included knife on glass, nails on a blackboard, fork on glass, and shrill screams[5]."}
{"answer": "If the US Government paid off all its debt, it would eliminate the risk of defaulting on its debt, which can happen in two ways: not raising or suspending the debt ceiling and not paying interest on Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. It could also potentially help the US Government make more money to pay down its debt through higher taxes and spending cuts[4]. However, it might not change the near-term or long-term fundamentals[3], and since Congress only works well against a stiff deadline, it might make our problems even worse[3]."}
{"answer": "Electric motion detecting hand towel dispensers are typically more expensive than mechanical spring-loaded dispensers, but are preferred in public restrooms for their sanitary benefits. They use a sensor to detect the user's hand motion and then dispense a length of paper towel, and include an electric power source and control circuitry, such as a microprocessor[2][3]. The motion sensors help to encourage a sanitary environment since users don't have to physically touch anything[4], and they are becoming more popular in places like restaurants[5]."}
{"answer": "Programs are allowed to use 100% CPU in order to perform computationally intensive tasks such as running games, video rendering, 3D modeling, or graphic design with large files[5]. However, when using standard programs like Microsoft Office or graphic design programs like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, CPU use should be between 5% and 30%[2]. Having a PC with a CPU at 100% all the time is not recommended as it can lead to engine failure[3]. It is also possible that malware or viruses on your PC may cause the CPU 100% usage issue, so it is important to scan your PC for viruses, spywares, or Trojans[4]."}
{"answer": "According to the references, it is theorized that the hottest temperature possible is the Planck temperature ($1.416\u00d710^{32}$ Kelvin)[1], and that infinite temperatures are not ruled out by theory[2]. However, it is not possible to heat a body to an infinite temperature because one needs a hotter body in order to heat a body[2]. The highest temperature an object can be is not known, but the CMB is one of the coldest places in the universe[4]. While it is theoretically possible for an absolute heat to exist, physics is not certain what the absolute hottest of hot looks like[5], so the highest temperature in the universe is not known.[4][5]"}
{"answer": "The difficulty in opening a refrigerator door the second time after closing it has to do with air pressure. When a refrigerator door is forced shut quickly or slammed shut, it forces air out of the fridge and lowers the mass of air inside the fridge, which lowers the pressure inside the fridge compared to the outside air pressure. This creates a vacuum which causes the door to be harder to open[5]. The larger the temperature difference between the inside and outside air, the greater the pressure of the vacuum, which is why freezer doors are usually harder to open than fridge doors[3]."}
{"answer": "The SpaceX Raptor engine is a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine that is highly efficient and has a number of advantages over conventional rocket engines[5]. It is the first engine of its kind to ever fly[2]. It is expected to eventually power the company\u2019s Starship to the Moon, to Mars, and beyond[2]. It is a fantastic engine to fulfill SpaceX\u2019s goals for their Starship vehicle, and would likely be the king of other applications, depending on the rocket scientists and engineers making the compromises[1]. The Raptor engine was first publicly discussed by SpaceX's Max Vozoff at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Commercial Crew/Cargo symposium in 2009[3]."}
{"answer": "Yes, we can please try to keep questions in this subreddit limited to those that actually require simplified answers. If you are looking to advertise your product or brand on Reddit, you need to ask the admins of the relevant subreddit for permission[5]. You can find subreddits that are most used by your target audience by exploring their subsections in the sidebar of the relevant subreddit[4]. Subreddits are sub-communities about a variety of topics and areas, which anyone can create[2]. In some cases, you can even create a separate subreddit to represent your brand[3]. Additionally, Reddit also features special terms for some subreddits[1]."}
{"answer": "The 13 colonies in the United States eventually joined together, but as individual colonies they were often more different than alike[1][2]. The colonies all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the Rights of Englishmen, which they were determined to protect from imperial interference[3]. Despite their differences, the colonies did have some key unifying factors, such as their economic dependence on slave labor and access to overseas markets[4]. However, the colonies were too jealous of their separate powers to agree to form a single colony, and the British government feared it might increase their strength and independence[5]. Additionally, the colonies were separated by geographical distance, differences of temper, religious thought, and custom, and by provincialism of spirit[5]."}
{"answer": "English poetry no longer has a strong culture because the English language has been widely used outside of England, with a number of major national poetries emerging and developing[1]. In addition, the original traits of Old English poetry, which were based on heroic themes and codes of conduct, are no longer relevant in today\u2019s multicultural English society[2][3]. Finally, the rise of print culture has altered the way poets think about the sound of poetry, leading to the development of a toneless free-verse line[5]."}
{"answer": "Inhaling and exhaling at certain points while doing abdominal exercises is important for several reasons. First, breathing helps stabilize the torso and allows muscles on the front such as the rectus abdominis and obliques to do their job easily[1]. Secondly, it is necessary to follow the principle of breathing (inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth) during abdominal exercises to get the maximum effect[2]. Additionally, inhalation during abdominal exercise can help with respiratory training, especially for those with disease states[3]. Lastly, exhalation is important during weight lifting because it reduces the amount of pressure in the abdomen and decreases the chances of sustaining internal injuries such as hernias and vessel strains[4]. Lastly, belly breathing (using the entire abdominal area for oxygen instead of just the top of the chest) can give you more energy for cardiovascular exercise[5]."}
{"answer": "Defragging rearranges the layout of files on your hard drive for faster access[2][5]. This process can increase data access performance for mechanical Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) that store information on disk platters, while it should be avoided for Solid State Disk Drives (SSDs) that use flash memory[2]. Defragging can also help solve and prevent a number of problems, such as a computer running slowly or freezing up, and it can give you more space on your hard drive[3]. Additionally, it is a safe process that is part of a Windows-based maintenance tool, and it is unlikely that your hard drive will suffer any harm even if you interrupt the process[1]."}
{"answer": "The term 'unisex' was coined in the 1960s and was used fairly informally. The combining prefix uni- is from Latin unus, meaning one or single, but the term seems to have been influenced by words such as united and universal, taking on the sense of shared rather than single[2][4]. Unisex then means something that is shared by both sexes and is suitable for either gender[2]. It is typically used to refer to clothing shops and hair stylists that serve both men and women[2]."}
{"answer": "An engine works by taking in air and fuel, compressing them together and igniting them to create an explosion that powers the car. Turbochargers and superchargers are called forced induction systems, as they compress the air flowing into the engine in order to increase power[2]. The key difference between a turbo charger and a super charger is that a supercharger requires engine power to run, while a turbocharger runs off waste (exhaust) energy created by the engine[1][4]. This means that overall turbochargers operate with higher efficiency, utilising exhaust energy which is typically lost in naturally-aspirated and supercharged engines[1]."}
{"answer": "Soap operas look the way they do because of the camera and production techniques used to make them. They are meant to feel like theatrical productions, with stories told onstage and no fourth wall[1]. The \"soap opera look\" is the result of budget limits and constraints, and is characterized by cost-effective lighting, motion interpolation, close-ups, and frequent cuts[3][4]. To get a soft glow around characters, production crews on old soap operas would smear a thin layer of petroleum jelly over the camera lens[5]. Before the 1970s, many soap operas were broadcast live, giving audiences the feeling of watching a play[5]."}
{"answer": "Companies typically determine the cost of acquiring a customer by calculating the total marketing and sales expenses over a certain period of time, such as a month, quarter, or year, and then dividing that total by the number of new customers acquired during that period[2]. Companies should strive to spend 33% or less of the customer's lifetime value on customer acquisition costs[3]. CAC is the total sales and marketing cost required to earn a new customer over a specific period[2][4], and is used to measure and maintain the profitability of acquisition teams[2][3][4]. The Cost per Customer Acquisition (or CAC) is the metric that determines how much it costs a company to get a new customer[4][5]."}
{"answer": "The Manson Family was a commune, gang, and cult led by criminal Charles Manson that was active in California in the late 1960s and early 1970s[1]. The group consisted of approximately 100 followers, many of whom were young women from middle-class backgrounds, who were attracted by hippie culture and communal living and then radicalized by Manson's teachings[1]. Three Manson women participated in the most notorious acts of Manson Family violence, the Tate-LaBianca murders[2][3]. The members of the Manson Family are extremely numerous; at its peak, the group consisted of about 100 casual followers and 30 core members[1][4]. Much of the research on the Manson Family has been based on Ed Sanders\u2019 The Family, and Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson, by Jeff Guinn, as well as taken from transcripts of the Manson trials and archival news reports[4]. According to Los Angeles magazine, former Family member said, \"Charles Manson got away with everything. People will say, 'He's in jail.' But Charlie is exactly where he wants to be\"[2]."}
{"answer": "Yes, besides cannabis, there are several objects that naturally contain THC. These include spices, herbs, plants, vegetables, and desserts. The three main forms of cannabis products are the flower/fruit, resin (hashish), and oil (hash oil)[2]. Marijuana or marihuana (herbal cannabis) consists of the dried flowers and fruits and subtending leaves and stems of the female cannabis plant and contains 3% to 20% THC[3]. Australia's National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre (NCPIC) states that the buds (infructescences) of the female cannabis plant contain the highest concentration of THC, followed by the leaves[4]. Cannabis tea, which contains relatively small concentrations of THC because THC is an oil (lipophilic) and is only slightly water-soluble (with a solubility of 2.8 mg per liter)[5]."}
{"answer": "G force suits work by using inflatable bladders and stretch fabric to apply pressure to specific areas of the body, such as the abdomen, thighs, and calves. This prevents the rush of blood to lower parts of the body, and ensures that pressure is balanced at every point of the body[3]. The Air Force is currently testing a new Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (Atags), which is expected to replace the current suit and increase crew high-G endurance by 350 percent[5]."}
{"answer": "Fostering is when someone brings a child into their family and provides them with life necessities and emotional support during a difficult and confusing time[1]. Foster parents work with Children's Aid staff to develop and support a plan of care for each child or youth in care[1][2][3]. The goal of fostering is to provide children with alternative family care until they can return to their natural family, another family setting, or an independent living situation[1][2][3]. Foster parents receive funding support from their local child welfare agency to help cover the costs of caring for the child, and additional support is available through charitable organizations[4]. The key goal of foster care is to ensure that kids are living in stable, lifelong families[5]."}
{"answer": "There are three standard grades of gasoline: 87 AKI (regular unleaded), 88-90 AKI (mid-grade), and 90-94 AKI (premium or high-grade). Regular unleaded is the lowest octane rating and cheapest option, while premium is the highest and most expensive[2]. It is important to select the right grade of gas for your car in order to get the best performance[3]. The different grades of gas usually have names such as \u201cSuper Premium,\u201d \u201cUltra,\u201d or \u201cUltimate\u201d which all refer to the gasoline octane rating[4]. The price differential between the grades of gasoline can help you decide which one to use for your vehicle[3][5]."}
{"answer": "The exact cause of mouth ulcers is still not known and varies from person-to-person[5]. However, there are some common causes and several factors that may contribute to or aggravate mouth ulcers, including injury (such as accidentally biting the inside of your cheek)[1][5], aphthous ulceration, certain medications, skin rashes in the mouth, viral, bacterial and fungal infections, chemicals and some medical conditions[1], and certain risk factors and triggers[3]."}
{"answer": "The main difference between a prime minister and president is that a prime minister is the head of government while a president is the head of state[2][4]. Additionally, a person gets to be either president or prime minister in different ways. For the most part, presidents are elected by the people[1], while prime ministers tend to be members of a legislature that chooses them to be its leader[1]. The differences between the two can vary greatly depending upon which countries you're trying to compare[3]. For example, in some countries the president is responsible for appointing the prime minister[4], while in other countries the president has the power to dissolve parliament."}
{"answer": "The maximum wattage for a CFL bulb is 25 watts. To replace a traditional 60-watt bulb, buy a 15-watt CFL[1][3][4][5]. If you want more light, you can bump up to a 23-watt CFL, which will give off as much light as the old 100-watt bulb did, while still staying below the 60-watt power cutoff[4]. It will take 4 1/3 CFL lamps at 23 watts each to equal the power that an incandescent 100W bulb will require[2]. Remember that the wattage listed on the label of newer-technology bulbs such as CFLs and LEDs is shorthand for \u201cProduces approximately the same lumens as a 60-watt incandescent bulb\u201d[5]."}
{"answer": "We are not constantly terrified of death or knowing how insignificant we are because, although we all have a fear of death, we can learn to be more comfortable with the topic by reminding ourselves of our mortality and death. Also, by living in denial of death, we can train our brain to fear even the concept of death[3], making it more difficult to cope with when it comes up. Fear of dying, on the other hand, is more focused on the pain and suffering that might be involved in the process of death[4]. Additionally, research has indicated that the Eastern philosophy of death, where life can't exist without death, allows individuals to use death as a reminder to enjoy life[5]."}
{"answer": "There is relatively little research on the effects of marijuana compared to other drugs because it is not as widely accepted or regulated in society, and there is still much debate about its safety and potential for abuse and addiction. Marijuana use is especially prevalent among young people, and studies have found that lower levels of perceived risk among this population are associated with higher use rates[4]. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that heavy marijuana use can be associated with impairments to physical and mental health, cognitive abilities, social life, and career status[5]."}
{"answer": "The advantages of deregulation include the stimulation of economic activity and improved innovation[2], increased market growth and investments in research and development[2], the removal of limitations[1][2], the promotion of competition and allocation of economic resources more efficiently[3], the development of competitive advantages to satisfy consumers[1][4], lower costs of operations[5], allowing more businesses to enter a market[4][5], and lower prices for consumers[1][4][5]. On the other hand, the drawbacks of deregulation include concepts like inflation, fraud, and consumer interests[1]."}
{"answer": "The United States uses NATO to intervene in other countries by stressing that the alliance should be the instrument of choice to deal with threats to the common interests of its members, wherever these threats arise[1]. The U.S. also argues that NATO should have the right to act on its own in matters of European security, without needing UN authorization[4]. However, given the lack of consensus within NATO on when and how to intervene, the U.S. favors leaving the decision on whether or not to use force up to the organization[2][5]. The U.S. does not have an obligation to intervene in Ukraine if Russia launches a full-fledged invasion, since Ukraine is not one of the 30 countries in NATO[3]."}
{"answer": "While the Taliban has spokespeople and Twitter accounts, it is difficult to track them down and end them because they have not broken any of Twitter's rules and have abided by the terms of service. Twitter has allowed them to keep their accounts[2][3], and it has been used by the Taliban since 2011 to target Western audiences and disseminate propaganda[4]. Twitter often and quickly bans accounts it deems to be spreading misinformation or sees as public threats, but has not done this in this case[5]."}
{"answer": "Air moves in planet earth due to uneven heating by the sun, which causes changes in atmospheric pressure, resulting in winds blowing from regions with high pressure to those with low pressure[1]. This process takes place in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere[2]. The air cools until it descends, creating a high pressure zone[3]. A few basic principles explain how and why air moves, such as warm air rising creating a low pressure zone at the ground, air flowing horizontally at top of the troposphere, and air flowing from areas of high pressure to low pressure creating winds[3]. Additionally, the consistent pattern to how air moves around the atmosphere is caused by the Sun heating the Earth more at the equator than at the poles, and is also affected by the spin of the Earth[3][5]."}
{"answer": "Smart cards, also known as chip cards, are credit cards with an embedded integrated chip that serves as a security token[1][2]. The chip and PIN technology was developed to reduce point-of-sale credit card number theft and skimming cybercrimes[5], and all U.S. merchants are mandated to accept EMV cards or face potential liability for any credit card fraud originating at their establishment[5]. The chip provides additional security for consumers and businesses and is difficult to crack as it has been designed with security in mind[1]."}
{"answer": "The Electoral College is a system in the United States where people vote for electors, who then choose the President and Vice President of the United States[1][2][3]. The Electoral College system is an important part of American federalism, as it maintains the Constitution's prescription of a federal election by which votes are tallied in each state, and the voters act both as citizens of the United States and as members of their state communities[4]. Proponents argue that if the US were to abolish the Electoral College, future presidential elections would become heavily skewed towards urban voters and big-city interests[5]."}
{"answer": "Eggs are used as an ingredient in every single recipe because they are a truly multifunctional ingredient with many roles to play in the bakeshop[3]. They may be used to add structure, flavor, texture or act as a leavening agent[5]. Eggs are also natural binders, helping hold all other baking ingredients together and increasing the viscosity of batters and doughs[1][2]. Additionally, egg whites have the capability to gel and are frequently used as a binding agent in many different prepared foods[2]."}
{"answer": "Aloe vera has anti-inflammatory compounds that can help reduce the inflammation caused by sunburns[2]. It can also help to moisturize the skin and prevent peeling[2]. A few studies have also shown evidence that aloe vera is beneficial in healing first- to second-degree burns, which include mild to moderate sunburns[4]. The American Academy of Dermatology also recommends using moisturizers containing aloe vera to soothe sunburns[5]. However, it is important to remember that preventing sunburns is the best way to avoid damage to your skin and DNA."}
{"answer": "Before takeoff, there is no air conditioning on the plane for several reasons. Firstly, the APU (Auxillary Power Unit) needs to be started in order to provide electricity and allow the aircraft to be disconnected from ground power, as well as provide the air needed to start the main engines and operate the air conditioning system[2]. Secondly, there may be delays in preparing the aircraft, such as not having it cleaned on time, which can affect the boarding time[3]. Lastly, the engines need to be run every seven days to keep them functional and the air conditioning switched on to keep the humidity at bay[4], and humidity needs to be kept low to prevent the spread of viruses."}
{"answer": "Educated/teachers and professors tend to be more liberal because they often have more open-minded views and may favor freedom of expression and thought, as well as being in favor of financial aid for students and intellectual diversity and tolerance of ideas[2]. This is further supported by data from college seniors surveyed in the U.S., which found that 49% of the sample said that their professors expressed politically liberal views \u2018frequently\u2019 or \u2018all the time\u2019, while only 9% said the same about conservative professors[4]. Additionally, lots of kids tend to become more liberal when they go to college because they have finally escaped the rigid ideological supervision of right-wing parents and traditional churches[3]. It is important to note, however, that while there is a tendency for professors to hold liberal views, \u201cdevout\u201d liberals or communists are pretty rare[5]."}
{"answer": "The random pains we sometimes experience for a second or two, in arbitrary places of the body could be referred pain, a symptom of a disorder such as trigeminal neuralgia, or simply acute pain caused by tissue damage. Referred pain occurs when signals from different parts of the body converge on the same neurons in the spinal cord[1], while trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by extreme, sporadic, sudden burning or shock-like facial pain[2]. Acute pain typically comes on suddenly and has a limited duration[5], and is frequently accompanied by anxiety or emotional distress[5]."}
{"answer": "Scientists have not been able to figure out exactly why insects are attracted to light[3]. However, they have come up with a few theories. One is that it is used for navigation and that specific insects used the moon, sun, and stars to fly before they evolved and adapted to artificial light[1]. Another theory is that light signals an escape from potential danger for insects, as it can tell them that a path is not blocked by a predator or obstacles[2]. Lastly, insects may be attracted to light because of its brightness and heat. However, the sun is too bright and too hot for insects, so it is unlikely that they would be attracted to it."}
{"answer": "Alaska does not have a tax exemption for foreign employees, so it would not apply to a European immigrant. The tax exemption provided under the Vienna Conventions or a bilateral consular agreement does not apply to alien employees who sign the waiver provided by section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (USCIS Form I-508) to obtain or retain lawful permanent resident status (green card) [2][3]. If the immigrant is from a country that has an income tax treaty with the United States, they should look at the tax treaty to see if there is a provision that exempts their compensation from U.S. tax [4]. However, this tax exemption only applies to compensation received for official services performed for the foreign government or international organization, and does not apply to any other U.S. source income such as interest, dividends, rents, or royalties [5]."}
{"answer": "After death, the human body undergoes a series of biological changes collectively referred to as decomposition[2]. These changes are caused by two key factors: decomposition islands, which are cadaver decomposition circles that form due to the seeping of broken-down materials out of the body[4], and the gradual exposure of the skeleton, which can survive in the ground for centuries[5]. Forensic archaeology and anthropology are used to study the changes that take place in the body after death."}
{"answer": "Breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth during deep breathing exercises helps to reduce the number of breaths taken and keeps your airways open longer, allowing more air to flow in and out of your lungs[2]. Nose breathing is more natural and helps your body effectively use the air you inhale, while mouth-breathing is only necessary during strenuous exercise or if your nasal passage is blocked[4]."}
{"answer": "Muscle twitches, also known as fasciculations, are minor, involuntary, repetitive motions of a skeletal muscle caused by small contractions of the affected muscle[3]. They are usually caused by the nerves sending signals that make the muscles move, even though the brain or spinal cord isn\u2019t telling them to[1]. Muscle twitches can be brought on by moving or just thinking about moving[4], and can affect the face, arms and legs[4]. They are usually not cause for serious concern, although in some cases they may indicate a nervous system condition[2][5]. To address the problem, you can try relaxation techniques or stretching the affected area[5]."}
{"answer": "Emergency brakes, also known as parking brakes, are auxiliary brake systems which can be used in multiple scenarios, including parking. The term \u201cemergency brake\u201d is derived from the fact that it was originally designed to be used in emergencies, such as when the service brakes stop working[5]. However, today these brakes are mostly used for parking[4]. Some automakers call it a parking brake, while some call it an emergency brake[2][3], and while the name implies it is only for emergencies, it is actually recommended that the emergency brake be used all the time when parking[2][5]."}
{"answer": "It is not possible to reuse candles with the used wax because the wax is not evenly melted and usually contains different types of wax like beeswax, paraffin or soy, which cannot be melted together. Other ideas to reuse the wax include mixing it with potpourri[1], melting it down and pouring it into a smaller votive[2], filling the jar with boiling water and applying pressure to pop the wax out[4], or melting in a saucepan or in the microwave and pouring into an ice cube tray or egg carton to create wax blocks for oil burners[5]."}
{"answer": "Guy Debord's concept of the 'spectacle' is a polemical and prescient indictment of our image-saturated consumer culture[2][5]. It is the everyday manifestation of capitalist-driven phenomena such as advertising, television, film, and celebrity[2]. Debord introduces three forms of the spectacle: the diffuse, the concentrated, and the integrated[1][2][4][5], which he says permeates all reality[4]. The spectacle functions as a pacifier for the masses, a tool that reinforces the status quo and quells dissent[5]. Debord said the spectacle says nothing more than \u201cthat which appears is good, that which is good appears\u201d[5] and demands passive acceptance[5]."}
{"answer": "The shower curtain rod in hotels is bowed out to give guests more standing and elbow room in tight spaces[1]. The curved shower rod pulls the shower curtain even further away from the shower wall and provides a more spacious shower experience[3][4][5]. It is designed to fit in standard 5 foot bath tubs or 6 foot showers or tubs[4]."}
{"answer": "Anti-satellite missiles are weapons that can temporarily impair or permanently destroy orbiting satellites. They are usually launched from the ground or from the wings of an airplane and destroy satellites by running into them at high speeds[2]. They can be used to disrupt crucial intelligence during war[3]. India tested an anti-satellite weapon on Wednesday, using a locally produced interceptor to destroy an object in orbit[4]. A similar weapon type, called co-orbital anti-satellite weapons, are first launched into orbit and then change direction to collide with the targeted satellite from space[5]."}
{"answer": "Chameleons and some squid are able to change colour due to the movement of pigments within chromatophores or due to muscle-controlled chromatophore organs changing the shape of pigment sacs[5]. Chameleons do not modify their hues by accumulating or dispersing pigments within their skin cells like other animals, instead they rely on structural changes that affect how light reflects off their skin[2][3]."}
{"answer": "Cheddar cheese is a hard English cheese made from cow's milk that has been coagulated with rennet, while American cheese is a processed cheese made from a blend of two or more \"real\" cheeses, like cheddar and colby, and other ingredients like whey, milk proteins, vitamins, coloring, and emulsifying agents[1][3]. Cheddar cheese has more flavor compared to American cheese, which is artificially processed and less expensive[2]. The ingredients of American cheese include cheddar cheese, whey, water, protein concentrate, milk, sodium citrate, calcium phosphate, milkfat, gelatin, salt, sodium phosphate, lactic acid as a preservative, annatto and paprika extract (color), enzymes, Vitamin A palmitate, and cheese culture, Vitamin D3[4]."}
{"answer": "Pumping your arms while running helps to reduce the overall metabolic cost of running by helping to balance the moving body, increase forward propulsion or, perhaps, provide a bit of bounce, helping to lift us off the ground with each stride[2]. According to Newton's Third Law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and pumping your arms helps to generate more force and momentum, which results in increased speed[3]. Research has also shown that arm swinging uses less energy and actually makes running much easier[4], even though it feels like it takes more effort than crossing them or letting them hang out along your sides[4]."}
{"answer": "Einstein's reasoning referenced by Brian Cox in this video on gravity is the Principle of Equivalence, which states that objects at rest behave the same[4]. Cox\u2019s experiment was to prove a more interesting hypothesis put forward by Albert Einstein in the 20th century[2]. Cox explained Einstein's theory by saying that the reason objects fall together is because they're not falling, they are standing still and there is no force acting on them[3]. This \"happiest thought of my life\" was put to the test at Nasa\u2019s Space Power Facility near Cleveland, Ohio to investigate theories of gravity from Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton[5]."}
{"answer": "The reasons why rich nations closer to Syria, such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, are not being pressured into taking in refugees are mainly due to the fact that these countries have not signed the international conventions on refugee rights and statelessness, and also have not officially recognized the legal concept of refugeehood[3]. Additionally, these countries are providing financial aid to the Syrian refugees, such as 900 million dollars since 2011[2], and have offered other kinds of support, such as the construction of 200 mosques in Germany[2]. Furthermore, these countries have the resources to take in the refugees and could easily provide them with a more suitable environment than other countries due to the cultural and linguistic ties shared with the refugees[1][2]."}
{"answer": "White trails from airplanes, commonly referred to as condensation trails or contrails, are created when the exhaust from a plane's engine combines with the low-temperature and low-vapor-pressure atmosphere at high altitude[1]. These trails form when water vapor condenses and freezes around small particles from the engine exhaust[1][2][5], and their appearance will depend on the humidity[1][3]. Contrails are actually a type of cirrus cloud and can stay around for a long time if the air is wet and cold enough[5]."}
{"answer": "A car driving through the hot sun does not get as hot as a car parked in the hot sun because the car is constantly moving and the air around the car is in motion, which helps to dissipate the heat. The car parked in the hot sun will heat up the most during the first 10 minutes[2], due to the greenhouse effect which is when sunlight passing through the windows into the car is mostly absorbed by interior surfaces, then radiated back to the air as heat[3]. Even if the car isn't left in direct sun, it still gets pretty hot inside[5]."}
{"answer": "Bratislava is located at the outskirts of Slovakia because it borders directly with Austria and Hungary, making it the only capital in the world which borders with two states at the same time[1][2][3]. Located only 60 km from the Austrian capital Vienna, it is the closest capitals in Europe[1][3]. It is also situated in the southwestern Slovakia, within the Bratislava Region and close to the borders of Austria and Hungary[1][2][3]. Additionally, Bratislava is the seat of the Slovak parliament, presidency, ministries, supreme court, and central bank[5], which is why it is the capital of Slovakia.[1][2][3]"}
{"answer": "The expiration date on painkillers is the date that the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of the medication[1][3]. The expiration date does not necessarily indicate a point at which the medication is no longer effective or has become unsafe to use[2]. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) began requiring expiration dates to be listed on all over-the-counter and prescription medications in 1979[4][5]. Therefore, the expiration date is a critical part of deciding if the product is safe to use and will work as intended[4]."}
{"answer": "When charging a battery, the chemical reactions within the battery are reversed using a battery charger. This takes energy in and stores it by resetting the battery chemicals to how they were originally. Electrical current passes through the battery and its specialized circuit, which allows the electrons to bond to the ions in the anode[1], resulting in a potential difference across the cell[4][5]. Additionally, some rechargeable batteries may lose their charge when not in use due to a phenomenon called self discharge[2]."}
{"answer": "The NFL has taken an informal approach to scheduling games on Saturdays after the end of the college football season, with the scheduling policy changing many times[2]. Typically, the majority of each week's games are played on Sunday afternoon, with a single nationally televised game each on Thursday night, Sunday night, and Monday night[3]. The rule was designed to encourage ticket-holders to show up at the stadium instead of watching another game on television[4]. Since 2018, NFL Network has exclusively aired three or four late-season Saturday games per season[1], and in 2021, ESPN and ABC will air a Saturday doubleheader during Week 18 featuring games with playoff implications[1]."}
{"answer": "Old people sound \u201cold\u201d because as we age our vocal chords weaken and become drier, our respiratory systems and torsos change, and our lungs and chest cavities become more rigid[4]. This causes higher pitched voices that sound thin, and less power behind our voices[4]. Other factors such as physical and social activity can also affect the sound of their voice, with those who are active having stronger voices and those who sing maintaining robust voices. Additionally, speech comprehension can decline with age, especially if the older person has any hearing difficulties or if the speech is rapid or distorted[2]."}
{"answer": "Humans (and most mammals) have individual teeth instead of a beak or solid bony structure because their adductor muscles that close the jaw comprise two major muscles which allow up-and-down and side-to-side movements of the jaw, making chewing possible[2][3]. This is unique to mammals, who also have heterodont teeth, meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth, as opposed to just one type and shape of tooth[2][3]. Additionally, most mammals are diphyodonts, meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: deciduous or \u201cbaby\u201d teeth, and permanent teeth[2][3][4]. Other vertebrates, such as reptiles and fish, have teeth that are attached to the palate or to the floor of the mouth, forming additional rows inside those on the jaws proper[5]."}
{"answer": "People look away from the point of focus to think because it helps them focus on their internal thoughts and memories. Research has found that people who look away to consider their response are more likely to come up with the correct answer to a question than those who maintain eye contact[3]. Looking to the left is often associated with reminiscing or trying to remember something[1][4], while looking to the right is often associated with more creative thoughts[4]. Constant and unwavering gaze is also a sign of attention[5]."}
{"answer": "Automatic machine translation is difficult because it provides literal word for word translation without taking context or true meaning into consideration[1], resulting in garbled, difficult to read and confusing translations[2]. It also fails to discern spelling errors, genders, and proper nouns[2], and the type of content that can work with machine translation depends on the language combinations needed and the type of content[3]. Despite being increasingly integrated into the tools we use every day[4], automatic machine translations cannot be called translations at all[5]."}
{"answer": "YouTube uses speech recognition technology to generate subtitles for videos automatically[2][3]. The subtitles are generated within a few hours to a day, and are around 60-70% accurate on average[2]. If the subtitles do not generate automatically, it could be due to mispronunciations, accents, background noise, or other reasons[3]. Users can edit the automatically generated transcript directly in YouTube to perfect the subtitles[1][2][3][5]. Once the subtitles are edited and the user is satisfied with the result, it can be activated to be displayed on the video for viewers[1]."}
{"answer": "Certain vibrant colours, particularly those on the far ends of the colour spectrum like some reds, violets, and blues, can cause eye strain because they have shorter wavelengths and are high energy[1]. Bright yellows can also cause eye strain after long periods because they reflect more light[2]. Staring at bright lights can damage your eyes because the retina\u2019s light-sensing cells become over-stimulated and release massive amounts of signaling chemicals, injuring the back of the eye[3]. Bright, saturated colors can also overstimulate the retinas and strain the eyes[2][4]. Eye discomfort can be caused by any light source, including the sun, fluorescent and incandescent light bulbs[5], and this is known as photophobia."}
{"answer": "Negative gearing is a tax policy that allows investors to deduct the costs of their investment property from their taxable income. This policy is used primarily by average workers who in the majority own only one investment property. It is argued that negative gearing inflates house prices, making it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder[3]. Additionally, the relatively low housing supply in Australia is seen to be a further reason that removing negative gearing would potentially have little effect[2]. There have been numerous discussions about abolishing Negative Gearing due to the rising property prices in Australia, however it needs to be considered in the bigger picture[4]. If negative gearing tax concessions for property were to get axed, it could have an effect on house prices across Australia[5]."}
{"answer": "A hedge fund is an alternative investment fund that pools capital from individual or institutional investors to invest in varied assets, often relying on complex techniques to build its portfolio and manage risk[1]. Hedge funds are typically managed by institutional investors who utilize a wide array of nontraditional investment strategies with the primary goal of mitigating risk[3]. The primary goal of a hedge fund is to produce positive returns[4][5]. Hedge funds are not regulated as much and operate with far less disclosure than mutual funds, and they have much higher minimum investment requirements[5]."}
{"answer": "The white, cloudy trails airplanes leave behind in the air are called contrails, which is a shortened version of the phrase \u201ccondensation trail\"[1]. They are created by the water vapour[2] that is released from the jet engine airplanes[3]. These contrails will gradually dissipate over the course of a few hours[3]."}
{"answer": "Consumer debt is considered to be a suboptimal form of financing, as it often comes with high interest rates that can become difficult to pay off[4]. It is on the rise in the United States due to the ease of obtaining financing and high interest rates[3]. If not managed properly, consumer debt can be financially crushing and adversely impact an individual's credit score, hindering their ability to borrow in the future[3]. Consumer debt consists of those loans used for personal consumption as opposed to debts incurred by businesses or through government activities[1][5]."}
{"answer": "The Dakota Access oil pipeline is a half-million-barrel-a-day project that is scheduled to begin moving oil on June 1, without an emergency response plan in place for the section of the line that skirts the Standing Rock reservation[3]. The protests against this project have become a huge story and have attracted an array of tribes, activists, and environmentalists around the country[2]. The lack of rigorous safety measures for the crude oil pipeline is raising serious concerns from lawyers and pipeline consultants for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe[5]. These concerns are valid, as the pipeline poses a threat to the clean water of the Standing Rock reservation and the environment in general."}
{"answer": "The aspect ratio of a screen or image is the proportional relationship between its pixel width and height[4]. Resolution, on the other hand, refers to the number of pixels in each direction[2][3]. Common aspect ratios are 16:9, 4:3 and 21:9, and these aspect ratios have corresponding resolutions that can be used. For example, the 16:9 aspect ratio has the following resolutions: 1024\u00d7576, 1152\u00d7648, 1280\u00d7720, 1366\u00d7768, 1600\u00d7900, 1920\u00d71080, 2560\u00d71440 and 3840\u00d72160[5]."}
{"answer": "The potential health risks to humans of pervasive plastic contamination include exposure to toxic chemicals and microplastics, which can cause cancer or hormonal disruption, reproductive, growth, and cognitive impairment, organ damage, and systemic effects such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, and epigenetic modifications[2]. Additionally, plastics increase disease risk by acting as a vessel for human pathogens[1], and research suggests that an average person could be ingesting approximately 5 grams of plastic every week[2]."}
{"answer": "Stains can become permanent if they are caused by certain substances that leave permanent marks on fabrics, such as milling oil, rust, old dirt spots, perspiration, or urine[1]. Certain types of fibers, such as wool, cotton, silk, and some nylons, are particularly susceptible to permanent staining from coffee, tea, wine, etc.[3]. Additionally, using the wrong stain removal methods or not treating the stain immediately can cause it to harden and become set, leading to permanent staining[5]."}
{"answer": "Sound can travel through walls due to sound reflection and flanking noise. Sound waves reflect off solid materials such as walls, pillars, and rocks, resulting in an echo[3]. Flanking noise is when sound travels around, under, and over obstacles in its path to reach a room[4]. An example of this is hearing your neighbor's TV and muffled voices through the wall[4][5]. Additionally, sound energy can travel through the wall by vibrating it and then passing through to the other side[2]. If you can feel a vibration on the wall, then it's impact noise[1]. If you can't feel a vibration but can still hear the noise, then it's airborne noise[1]."}
{"answer": "Controlling bowel movements while sleeping involves establishing a bedtime routine that includes a consistent schedule and rituals that ensure restful, high-quality sleep, such as keeping the bedroom dark, cool, and free of screens[4]. Eating meals at least two hours before going to sleep can also help to avoid having stomach acids go up the esophagus and causing irritation in the bowel movement[5]. Additionally, getting a good night's rest can act as a solid preventive health measure, and if you're already living with gastrointestinal discomfort or irritable bowel syndrome, it won't hurt to work on improving your sleep schedule[2]."}
{"answer": "Stephen Hawking's speech translator works by using a speech-generating device (SGD) or a voice output communication aid which either supplements or replaces speech/writing for people with communication difficulties[2][3]. The computer system was replaced every two years to cope with the gradual loss of control over his muscles over time. The user interface (now called ACAT, after Assistive Contextually Aware Toolkit) includes contextual menus that provide Hawking with various shortcuts to speak, search or email, and a new lecture manager, which gives him control over the timing of his delivery during talks[4]. Hawking also used a spelling card, and a computer program called Equalizer developed by WordsPlus to help those with ALS[5]. Finally, he used a speech synthesizer (developed by Speech+) to speak the complete sentence once it had been approved or completed[1]."}
{"answer": "It is natural to fear for your safety when a group of strangers on the street is laughing, as laughter is a defensive social mechanism that tells the pack that a perceived threat or confusing situation is not actually a threat[5]. People may unconsciously laugh when they are afraid or hurt[1], as their brains may get confused and think that something is threatening them[2]. Laughing is also a way to say 'I'm friendly and you don't have to worry about me'[3][4], and it is a way to cope with a scary or confusing situation[4]."}
{"answer": "The Yugoslav Wars were a series of separate but related ethnic conflicts, wars of independence, and insurgencies fought in the former Yugoslavia from 1991 to 2001, which led to the breakup of the Yugoslav state in 1992. Its constituent republics declared independence, despite unresolved tensions between ethnic minorities in the new countries, fuelling the wars[3]. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reported in 1995 that 90 percent of all the atrocities in the Yugoslav wars up to that point had been committed by Serb militants[4]. The US and its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) felt compelled to intervene and launched air wars against Serbia, the most powerful state of former Yugoslavia[1]. The US and its allies were motivated by the desire to bring stability and protect human rights in the region, as well as to prevent the spread of violence to other countries in the region."}
{"answer": "Cold weather can make scrapes and other injuries feel more painful for several reasons. Cold weather can cause skin to dry out and crack, and also make existing injuries worse by causing an already bothersome muscle or tendon to tense up or tighten[1]. Cold weather can also force your muscles to work harder to complete the same tasks they could more easily perform in warmer weather, resulting in more soreness and muscle damage[3]. In addition, decreased levels of exercise during winter months, pain receptors at trauma sites becoming more susceptible to cold and increased pain susceptibility as a result of chronic disease may also contribute to the feeling of increased pain due to cold weather[4]."}
{"answer": "Freckles are the result of an overproduction of melanin, a pigment that gives our skin, hair, and eyes their color[3]. Melanin also protects our skin from sun damage by absorbing and reflecting UV light[4]. Frequent sunburns and a gene known as MC1R, which provides instructions for making melanin, can lead to the overproduction of melanin and thus, freckles[2]. Despite the fact that skin cells constantly regenerate and replace old cells, the deeper layers of skin, known as the dermis, do not go through this cellular turnover and thus, do not replace themselves, meaning that the freckles will remain[5]."}
{"answer": "Trees and coral are able to constantly grow while humans and most other animals stop growing as adults because they have what is known as \"indeterminate growth\". This means that they will keep growing until they die, and their growth is not limited by a predetermined life span[3]. Trees, for example, get taller and thicker with age as long as they have access to resources[3]. Corals also grow in winter and summer due to seasonal changes in ocean temperature, pH, availability of nutrients and differences in light irradiance[4]. Lastly, coral reefs are able to grow and maintain their large size due to a mutual exchange between the tiniest ocean animals and plants which has been going on for 25 million years[5]."}
{"answer": "A web scraper is a specialized tool designed to quickly and accurately extract data from a web page[1][2][5]. It is used as part of the web scraping process to make HTTP requests on a target website and extract web data from a page[2][5]. Web scraping tools can be large frameworks designed for all kinds of typical scraping tasks, but you can also use general-purpose programming libraries and combine them to create a scraper[3]. Web scrapers can extract all the data on particular sites or the specific data that a user wants[4][5]. Web scraping requires two parts, namely the crawler and the scraper[5]. The crawler is an artificial intelligence algorithm that browses the web to search for the particular data required by following the links across the internet, while the scraper is a specific tool created to extract the data from the website.[5]"}
{"answer": "Cooking with azeotropes is a form of distillation used to separate mixtures of liquids or a liquid-gas mixture that cannot be separated by simple distillation[1][2][3]. An azeotropic mixture is one in which the vapour and fluid phases have the same concentration[4], and have constant or similar boiling temperatures, and the vapour has the same chemical composition as the liquid[1][4][5]. Azeotropes are composed of two or more components that form a solution with a constant boiling point, meaning that the components cannot be separated by normal distillation, so a distillation agent with a different boiling point than the components of the azeotrope is added[3]."}
{"answer": "Getting the \"wind knocked out\" of you is an idiom that refers to the difficulty of breathing and temporary paralysis of the diaphragm caused by reflex diaphragmatic spasm when sudden force is applied to the upper central region of the abdomen and solar plexus[1]. This is actually a diaphragmatic spasm caused when a sudden force is applied to the celiac plexus[1][2][3]. This usually happens after a blow to the abdomen or back[1][5], and while this may not be a life-threatening condition, it can be scary for the person struggling to breathe[5]. This state of paralysis usually resolves within a few minutes[5]."}
{"answer": "Poop is almost always brown because of the processes and chemical reactions that take place in your gut when your food is digested[4]. Bile and bilirubin, which are both a yellowish color, mix with your digested food, intestinal secretions, bacteria, and old red blood cells in your digestive tract and turn your waste brown[5]. This is because your body is typically very good at making sure that no useful food goes to waste[3]. Poop is not always brown and its color can vary, depending on what you eat and how fast the stuff moves through your system[2]."}
{"answer": "If mosquitos were to disappear, the entire ecosystem would be affected but not collapse, as they are not a keystone species in any habitat[1]. There would be a cascade effect across food chains and in all connected habitats, as some fish would have to find alternative food sources[2][5]. This would be particularly difficult for specialized predators such as the mosquitofish, which could actually go extinct[3][5]. The absence of mosquitoes would also disrupt the food chain in the Arctic tundra, where several mosquito species provide food for migratory birds, causing the number of birds in the area to drop by more than half[5]. Other insects and fish that feed on mosquitoes would also dwindle in number, causing a ripple effect throughout the food chain[5]."}
{"answer": "Water is reflective because the wave impedance of water is different than the one of air, and the electric and magnetic field must be continuous everywhere in space[3][4]. When the water in a lake or sea is very still, the reflection of the landscape is perfect, because the reflecting surface is very flat[1][3]. However, when there are ripples or waves in the water, the reflection becomes distorted due to the humps and troughs caused by the wind[1]. The index of refraction of water (1.33) is significantly larger than that of air (1.0003), which is why light reflects and passes through the surface of water[3]. Additionally, depending on conditions, water or even glass will reflect and pass light to varying percentages, making the surface act like a mirror or like glass[5]."}
{"answer": "Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms, and her duties include undertaking constitutional and representational duties, visiting charities, hosting visiting Heads of State, taking part in annual programmes of investitures, garden parties, receptions and other ceremonies[1]. Historically, the British monarch used to have actual legislative powers, but now the Queen\u2019s role is strictly politically neutral and ceremonial and all political powers lie with the elected Parliament[2]. She has the ability to \u201cbe consulted, to encourage and to warn\" and holds weekly meetings with the Prime Minister[2]. As head of state, Elizabeth II exercises the discretionary power of her role, but always speaks and acts on the advice of ministers[4]. She also promotes British goods when she visits other countries, such as Latin America[5]. Her position is mainly ceremonial and honorary in nature."}
{"answer": "Ears are shaped the way they are for the purpose of magnifying incoming waves of sound and transforming them into signals the brain can interpret. This allows us to hear the sounds of nature and other noises around us. The shape of human ears helps us hear better[2][3]. Ear lobe shapes, whether attached or low hanging, tend to be genetic and haven\u2019t been shown to have any acoustical effect, though there are many nerves in them[4]. Ears are also a unique and individual piece of anatomy[5]."}
{"answer": "Houses in suburbs are usually numbered in a peculiar way because it is part of a house numbering scheme that varies by location. In some areas of the world, including many remote areas, houses are named but are not assigned numbers. In Europe, the most common house numbering scheme is to number each plot on one side of the road with ascending odd numbers, from 1, and those on the other with ascending even numbers, from 2 (or sometimes 0)[4]. In Uruguay, house numbering starts at a high number among the hundreds or the thousands, and the term 'bis' is added when a house is divided or added between another[1]. In the rural parts of Finland, a variant of this method is used, where the house number indicates the distance in tens of metres from the start of the road[3]. In Venice, houses are numbered within six named series (one per sestiere district)[5]."}
{"answer": "Eating a big meal can cause the food to linger in your stomach and push up against your diaphragm, resulting in shallow breaths. It can also cause digestive fluids to sneak back up into your esophagus, causing heartburn, a sour or acidic taste in your mouth, and dyspepsia or indigestion[4]. Eating too quickly can also cause you to overeat before your body gets the fullness signal, which can lead to indigestion and discomfort. Lying down after eating a big meal can worsen heartburn[1], and eating food that is fatty, greasy, or spicy can also cause dyspepsia[5]."}
{"answer": "People may be scared of bugs due to their alien appearance, operating in large swarms or colonies, which can overwhelm the human psyche and damage the highly valued human beliefs regarding individuality[1]. People may also fear bugs because, even though they are much smaller than humans and can be easily squashed, they are still unfamiliar and potentially dangerous[3]. Additionally, some bugs bite or sting and can spread diseases[5], which can be a source of fear for people.[1][4]"}
{"answer": "Modern art tends to be more about the idea behind the art instead of the art itself because modern art is marked by innovation, experiment, and an almost dogmatic belief in reason and progress, pushing the artist to discover new forms of art, innovating their style, medium and subject matter, freeing themselves from academic conventions, and abolishing tradition in their quest for modern art[1]. Modern art also plays an essential role as a stimulus that can provoke independent thoughts and even emotions, and it gives the audience an opportunity to embrace new ideas and reflect on changes in the world and our lives differently[3]. Furthermore, modern art aims to reject traditional aesthetic values through the reimagining or reinterpretation of scenes and ideas and modern artists were determined to move with the times and stay current[4]. In comparison to Postmodern Art, Modern Art remains strongly connected to the traditional art forms, staying true to the best-known media such as painting, drawing or sculpture[5]."}
{"answer": "The main difference between rap and hip hop is that rap is one of the expressions of hip hop, while the latter is a whole culture that encompasses other aspects in addition to the musical part[1][2][4]. Rap is a musical genre of American origin characterized by the use of vocal rhymes, while hip hop is a culture that includes various artistic expressions such as graffiti, dance, rhymes (rap), and music[1]. From a community message angle, rap is a tool used to express current events and to tell the stories of people within the local community, while hip hop music is used to express hope for the future and to remember the successes of the past[4]. To sum up, musically, both hip-hop and rap have some little differences, albeit very similar, but hip-hop encompasses something much larger[5]."}
{"answer": "We figured out what each of our organs do by studying their structure, function, and communication with other organs and organ systems. For example, the heart needs to know when the digestive organs need more blood so that it can pump more[1], and to properly breathe, the lungs must work with the nose, mouth, throat, windpipe, and sinuses[2]. We also determined the identity of organs by determining their function, and organized them into organ systems to perform specific functions[5]."}
{"answer": "There are several reasons why things physically hurt more when we are cold. One is that the nerves in your hand get much more sensitive and your veins constrict, leading to less blood flow to your extremities, making skin more rigid and applying pressure to sensitive nerves[4]. Also, cold temperatures can trigger a body's chemical response to anxiety or depression, amplifying joint pain[1]. Additionally, the body's natural reaction to extremely cold temperatures is to tell the brain that it is in pain as a form of protection[2]. For people with chronic illnesses, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the extreme cold can make the pain even worse[3]. Lastly, cold weather makes us less active, leading to decreased circulation, increased stiffness and pain[5]."}
{"answer": "Computers convert binary into instructions by translating the binary code into assembly language, which contains simple instructions such as ADD, SUB, DIV, MUL, etc. and explains how the binary should interact[1]. Binary is also converted to text by assigning the data an American Standard Code for Information Interexchange (ASCII) value[4]. The computer then uses the ASCII standard conversion to convert the binary data back to text[4][5]. For example, the binary 01101010 can be converted to the decimal value 106, which is recognized as the letter j.[4][5]"}
{"answer": "It is racist to make decisions based on race because it perpetuates racism in society and can lead to unfair treatment and oppression of people of color[2]. Research has also shown that racism, including unconscious or implicit bias, can influence clinicians' behavior and decisions, and in turn, patient behavior and decisions[1]. This can lead to higher treatment dropout, lower participation in screening, avoidance of health care, delays in seeking help and filling prescriptions, and lower ratings of health care quality[1]. Race is not a reliable predictor of outcome or behavior and basing decisions on race can lead to biased decisions that are not in the best interest of the person being affected."}
{"answer": "Integral spin (also known as integer spin) is a quantum number where the spin of a particle takes values that are whole numbers, such as 0, 1, 2, etc. Half-integral spin (also known as half-integer spin) is a quantum number where the spin of a particle takes values that are half integers, such as 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, etc. Particles of integer spin obey Bose-Einstein statistics, whereas those of half-integer spin behave according to Fermi-Dirac statistics. All known fermions, the particles that constitute ordinary matter, have a spin of 1/2[4]. Particles having net spin 1/2 include the proton, neutron, electron, neutrino, and quarks[3][5]. The dynamics of spin-1/2 objects cannot be accurately described using classical physics[5]."}
{"answer": "Women moan and scream during sex for a variety of reasons. One reason is because it is an automatic response to pleasure[3][4]. Moaning also helps women to get their brain where their bodies are, allowing them to be more present and enjoy the act more wholeheartedly[5]. Additionally, some women may moan and scream as a way to make their partner feel happy and pleased[3]. Finally, moaning is a form of expressing an indescribable time that women can't help but express in different noises[2]."}
{"answer": "The US chose not to include the release of prisoners in the new nuclear deal with Iran because they were not sure Iran would uphold the prisoner release deal and they did not want to risk paying money to Iran in exchange for prisoners. The US government has maintained that the issue of the four people held in Iran is separate from the nuclear negotiations[4]. Furthermore, the $400 million payment to Iran was not a ransom payment as it was not made in exchange for the release of prisoners, only the timing of the payment was linked to the release[5]."}
{"answer": "Chewing mint gum causes a thermal illusion that happens when our sensory receptors get fooled by stimuli[1]. This is because the mint flavor contains methanol, which triggers a reaction in the mouth that makes it feel colder than it actually is[3]. This is why water feels colder when you chew minty gum, even though it is the same temperature as before.[3]"}
{"answer": "The green shimmer that sometimes appears on bacon is usually caused by the way in which the bacon has been cured and is usually harmless[1]. It is the result of nitrite reacting with the myoglobin in the bacon, which causes the \u201cnitrite burn\u201d and gives the meaty part of the bacon a green pigment[2]. In most cases, a light green sheen on your bacon isn't cause for alarm[5]. However, discolored bacon may indicate that the meat is not fit for consumption and should be thrown away[5]. This includes bacon with a greyish tinge, green spotted areas, slimy texture, or unusual smell[5]."}
{"answer": "Reading is good for the brain because it helps to relax the brain after a busy day and also keeps the memory strong by engaging various brain functions such as phonemic awareness, visual and auditory processes, and comprehension[2]. It also heightens overall brain function and increases memory[5]. Furthermore, reading is linked to a longer life and can lower the levels of beta-amyloid, a brain protein involved in Alzheimer\u2019s[5]."}
{"answer": "The Moon is the official name of Earth's satellite in English, as it is derived from a Proto-Germanic word that came into use a few thousand years ago in Northern Europe[3]. Other languages have different names for Earth's moon such as Merenda (Arabic), Bulan (Malay) and Selene (ancient Greek). Other moons in the solar system have been given names, usually after mythical figures or gods, to differentiate them from Earth's Moon[1]. The primary reason why our largest satellite does not have a more colourful name like the other moons in the solar system is because it is still officially known as the Moon in English[1][4]."}
{"answer": "The different voltages used in different countries are rooted in the history of electrical power generation[1]. Europe originally used 120V, just like Japan and the US today, but it was deemed necessary to increase voltage to get more power with fewer losses and less voltage drop from the same copper wire diameter[2]. The US decided not to change due to the cost involved to replace all electric appliances[2]. Many nations also use different plugs and a number of plug adapter kits are available for connecting to foreign plugs, but connecting to foreign plugs without a transformer or voltage converter can result in fireworks[3]. It is also important to check if the device is capable of handling the lower 50 hertz cycle found in much of the world or the higher 220 volts of electricity[3]. The different voltage standards are believed to be rooted in a feud between Tesla and Edison[5]."}
{"answer": "The Middle East has been in chaos in the past decades due to a combination of factors. These include the incompetence, repression, and corruption of their regimes, a global economic crisis[2][5], political clashes and violent conflicts across swaths of the region[3], and foolish and reckless US foreign policy which backs autocrats and provokes instability[2]. Additionally, the region is facing a race against the clock to deal with and manage Iran\u2019s nuclear and non-nuclear ambitions and its Shia proxies, the disintegrated nation-states, the Salafi terrorist threat, the passivity of the US, the new Russian presence in the region, the economic crisis and popular discontent[5]."}
{"answer": "Dental identification is done by comparing a deceased person\u2019s teeth and jaws with the missing person\u2019s dental records, using X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans[3]. Forensic dentists can also estimate a person's age and ethnicity based on the length and shape of their teeth[2]. However, if there is no name to compare the dental records with, dental identification is not possible since there is no national database of dental records that is searchable by dental charting[5]."}
{"answer": "SethBling managed this code injection in Super Mario World by using a number of well-known glitches and positioning Mario at certain coordinates in one of the levels[1][3]. He used the \"powerup\" glitch to make it seem like Mario had reached the 21st level of his powerups, which doesn't exist in Super Mario World[2]. He then added code to the game that enabled him to display Mario's X position, which acted as the values in the code Seth wrote, by doing a spin jump with Mario[2][3]. Finally, he exploited a tiny hiccup in the Super Nintendo game Super Mario World to allow him to carefully rewrite its memory, eventually repurposing sprites and level assets into a recreation of Dong Nguyen's super-popular Flappy Bird[5]."}
{"answer": "Creationists are often opposed to the theory of evolution because they believe that it contradicts the Judeo-Christian creation stories in the Bible, such as the seven-day creation story of Genesis, Noah's Ark, and the creation story of Adam and Eve[1][2]. Creationists also argue that evolution is a religion and that they are not the only ones with religious beliefs[3]. According to a study, 29.7% of students chose a special creationist personal view that God created species separately, 25.3% accepted that all of life shares a common ancestor but with God having some role in it, 25.4% accepted the common ancestry of life but said it was uncertain whether God was involved, and 19.5% accepted the common ancestry of life but believed that God played no role in evolution[4][5]. Therefore, it can be concluded that Creationists disbelieve in evolution because of their interpretation of the Bible, and that there is a wide range of beliefs when it comes to how God is involved in the process of evolution."}
{"answer": "Debates between republican and democrat candidates are called debates because they are typically sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates and involve the party's presidential and vice-presidential nominees. During the primaries, debates are typically formed from agreements between the media, a political party, and the potential candidates from a given party[5]. However, many republicans have been avoiding debates as a way to express disdain for the national media[1][2][4]."}
{"answer": "Quantum computers can break the encryption we use to protect emails, bank accounts, and other sensitive data by running algorithms such as Grover's Algorithm and Shor's Algorithm[3]. Grover's Algorithm weakens the standard symmetric algorithms, so key size can be doubled to protect against it[3]. Shor's Algorithm, on the other hand, completely breaks all the standard asymmetric algorithms at any key size[3]. This means an attacker can recover the key being used and decrypt the traffic or impersonate the peer without attacking the symmetric algorithm at all[3]. As a result, new asymmetric algorithms that are secure against quantum computers need to be developed[3][4]. While quantum computing will break much of our current encryption methods, it is not yet practical enough to cause significant damage[5]."}
{"answer": "North Korea adopted the title of \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" (DPRK) to represent Pyongyang as the true, legitimate Korean government and to distinguish itself from South Korea, which is officially called the Republic of Korea in English[1][2][3]. This title was adopted in 1948 after the division of Korea into North and South[3]. Despite its official title, North Korea's political system is actually an absolute monarchy or a \"hereditary dictatorship\"[4], and the DPRK is a socialist state that represents the interests of all the Korean people[1][2][5]."}
{"answer": "A computer screen works by displaying information relayed to it via a computer's video card. This information is processed in real-time, allowing users to interact with the computer instantaneously[4]. Most computer screens use cathode ray tube (CRT) technology, which uses an electron beam created inside the tube that is directed by magnetic fields to hit a screen that glows when hit by the electron beam[5]. Flat screen displays like laptops and panel monitors use liquid crystal display (LCD) or thin film transistor (TFT) technology[3]. Laptop displays are fully integrated into the computer itself and cannot operate independently of one another[2]."}
{"answer": "The euro is currently worth slightly more than the U.S. dollar in international markets[1][5]. This is due to the U.S. dollar surging in value so much that it is nearly equal to the euro for the first time in 20 years[2]. This means the two currencies are worth the same amount[3][5], and Americans are effectively getting a discount on goods and services denominated in euros[4]. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the value of American money against six major foreign currencies, has jumped nearly 12% this year to a two-decade high[5]."}
{"answer": "The suit became the norm for formal dressing everywhere due to a combination of factors, such as the democratization of wealth, the simplification of fashion, cloth rationing during the Second World War, and the introduction of new trends such as loose fitting coats, tapered trousers and arms, and double-breasted suit coats in the 1930s[2]. Additionally, the morning coat gradually rose in relative formality and became acceptable for businessmen, while the lounge suit was slowly accepted as being correct outside its original settings[5]."}
{"answer": "Many companies still view tattoos as unprofessional because they are worried about the opinions of customers and other people, and some tattoo designs are seen as unprofessional[3]. There has been a shift in company protocols and the trend seems to be towards the tattooed[1], but opinions of tattoos still vary widely.[3][5]"}
{"answer": "Cheese has been a part of French cuisine and culture for centuries, and there are several reasons why it is so important. One is that the French have an obsession with rules when it comes to classifying and eating food, which helps to preserve the product and associated traditions that are distinctly French in the face of globalization[1]. Another reason is that cheese is viewed as a symbol of French national identity, and there is an emphasis on consuming cheese in the \"proper\" way[4]. Finally, cheese originated as a peasant food in medieval times and has since become popular around the world, leading to a desire to protect the authenticity of French cheeses[5]."}
{"answer": "Sous-vide is a method of cooking that involves vacuum packing food and gently cooking it in temperature controlled water[1][2][3]. It literally means \u201cunder vacuum\u201d in French[1]. It is suitable for the preparation of meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, desserts and even cocktails[2]. There are advantages to this cooking technique, such as it being able to produce food with a consistent texture and flavor, but there are also some drawbacks[4]."}
{"answer": "Banks are very careful when it comes to the numbers in their database and they pay close attention to the money they are accountable for[2]. A bank would not be able to artificially inflate someone's number without it being detected, as it would have to be cross-referenced to the various accounts that put money in or took it out of the account[5], and if the number was just made bigger, the whole thing wouldn't balance and be picked up by the auditors/accountants[5]."}
{"answer": "A law needed to be passed telling federal employees that they couldn't participate in insider trading because members of Congress have enormous amounts of inside nonpublic information that can be used to buy or sell stocks, and insider trading is a felony that is difficult to prove[1]. Insider trading laws in the United States are a patchwork, with some incidents allowed and others not[3]. In December 2020, a letter was written to congressional leaders of both parties in the House and Senate explaining why they should put a ban on stock trading while in office in order to prevent any conflict-of-interests, such as insider trading[4]."}
{"answer": "Waking up at 2:30 AM can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, activating the sympathetic nervous system[1][4], lighter sleep cycles[5], and underlying health conditions[5]. When you wake up suddenly in the middle of the night, your mind may start to race, and your heart rate and blood pressure may go up, making it harder to get back to sleep[4]. This can cause any worries or problems that didn't seem like a big deal during the day to suddenly seem life threatening and world ending."}
{"answer": "Mathematicians and astronomers are able to predict solar and lunar eclipses thousands of years in advance by using a combination of modern computers and calculational methods[2], as well as advanced mathematical calculations. Ancient astronomers were able to predict eclipses with less accuracy, up to 50 years in advance[1]. Ancient people also used the Saros cycle, which is a pattern of eclipse predictions that occur at intervals of 223 lunar months, and which last for around 1000 years[5]."}
{"answer": "We crave the cold side of the pillow because it helps our body to cool down and relax more efficiently in order to get better sleep[1][3]. Our bodies like to be surrounded by an environment that is near the same temperature as our skin[5], and because our body temperature drops dramatically in the night[5], we look for a cooler surface to balance out the warmth we release. The colder side of the pillow allows us to cool off and get the good night\u2019s sleep we\u2019ve been craving for[1][2]."}
{"answer": "Getting the wind knocked out of you is actually a diaphragmatic spasm caused when a sudden force is applied to the celiac plexus[2][3][4][5]. When this force, usually from a fall or sports injury, is applied to the abdomen or back, it puts pressure on the celiac plexus (aka 'solar plexus'), which is a collection of nerves located centrally in the body. This pressure results in a spasm, or 'freezing,' of the diaphragm, the dome-shaped muscle under your lungs that regulates breathing[5]. It usually only lasts a few minutes before the diaphragm relaxes and the body resumes its regular breathing.[5]"}
{"answer": "Audio vacuum tubes are small devices used within the circuitry of a piece of gear, such as classic guitar and bass amps, instruments, and stereo systems[1]. They are used to create the characteristic sound associated with a vacuum tube amplifier, known as tube sound or valve sound[3]. Tube World Express is a division of Tube World, Inc. that offers the best sounding audio vacuum tubes on the market[2]. Western Electric engineered, designed, produced, or experimented with over 785 different tubes[4], many of which are still in very high demand today. Tube World stocks one of the most extensive inventories of WE tubes[4], making it the perfect place to find the perfect tubes for your amplifier[5]."}
{"answer": "The Large Hadron Collider has had a significant economic impact on mankind, particularly on the countries involved in its construction and operation. It has been estimated to have cost $5 billion to build and $1 billion each year to run[3]. In addition, it has been shown to yield significant socio-economic value, well in excess of its costs, in terms of its scientific output[1]. It has also had a positive impact on education and infrastructure[2]. However, the proposed Future Circular Collider (FCC) is uncertain to be constructed due to its high cost and the potential unwillingness of the participating countries to pay for it[4]. Therefore, the economic impact of the Large Hadron Collider on mankind will depend greatly on whether the FCC is built or not."}
{"answer": "Libertarians oppose the militarization of police forces as they believe that it is unjustified and violates citizens' rights to due process, privacy and freedom of speech. At the same time, they ardently support the 2nd Amendment as they believe it grants citizens the right to purchase and keep any firearm they wish for self-defense[1]. They are opposed to any form of gun control, as they believe it is not about crime control but about people control[4]. They also reject any form of gun registration or background checks that allow the government to create lists of what citizens own, as they believe such lists can lead to the confiscation of citizens' weapons[5]."}
{"answer": "It is so hard for smokers to stop smoking for several reasons. Nicotine is highly addictive, making it difficult for smokers to break free from its grip. Also, most people who smoke started when they were children, so it becomes a regular, necessary fix[4]. Additionally, nicotine can give smokers a temporary high, and when this is taken away, intense cravings and physical withdrawal symptoms can occur[5]. Lastly, quitting smoking requires a lot of willpower and multiple attempts, and only a small percentage of those who try to quit are successful[2]."}
{"answer": "Facebook and Google use tracking technologies like web cookies to collect information about our browsing activities from site to site. This data is then compiled by marketers and ad tech companies to target us across our devices[4]. This means that even if you get off of Facebook entirely, you can still be targeted[2]. This can be very annoying after purchasing or researching something on the internet[3], but there are a few simple hacks and edits to your settings that can make targeted ads a thing of the past[1]."}
{"answer": "Flies keep on landing on the same spot after being scared away because there is something attractive about the point where they are landing, such as a potential food source or a good vantage point for easy departure and flying away[1]. Also, flies have compound eyes that allow them to see all around them without having any blind spots[4], so they do not view humans as a threat. They are also attracted to sweat and other secretions on the skin, as well as proteins, carbohydrates, salts, sugars and other chemicals and pieces of dead skin that keep flaking off[5]."}
{"answer": "It is possible that a \"wood age\" existed for certain civilizations that lived near forests and had easy access to quality timber[3]. Historian Yuval Harari writes that the Stone Age should more accurately be called the \"Wood Age\"[2][4], as most of the tools used by ancient hunter-gatherers were most likely made of wood[2][4]. There is evidence to suggest that a wood revolution occurred when humans began to use stone tools, allowing them to shape wood in new ways[5]. However, due to the lack of organic material that has been preserved, it is difficult to know for sure."}
{"answer": "Death row inmates are housed separately because they are subject to much more deprivation and harsher conditions than other prisoners[5]. They are typically placed in solitary confinement until their execution dates, regardless of their behavior or risk to others[1], and the isolation can worsen mental illness[2] or physical disabilities[2]. Additionally, death row is one of the highest-security housing units within a prison system[3], and is located in its own separate units in existing high-security prisons[3]."}
{"answer": "The National Security Council (NSC) is an executive branch governmental body responsible for coordinating policy on national security issues and advising chief executives on matters related to national security[1]. The NSC lies at the heart of the national security apparatus, being the highest coordinative and advisory body within the government in this area aside from the President's Cabinet[2]. The NSC was established by statute in 1947 to create an inter-departmental body to advise the President with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security[3][4]. The statutory members of the Council are the President, Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and, since 2007, the Secretary of Energy; but, at the President's request, other senior officials participate in NSC deliberations[3][4]. The National Security Council differs from other federal agencies as it has a statutory role and is the highest coordinative and advisory body within the government in relation to national security matters[2][3][4]. It is also responsible for processing FOIA requests for classified documents[5]."}
{"answer": "Some people think that federal debt doesn't matter because as long as the US federal government remains an \u201congoing concern\u201d, there is no economic reason to fear default on the nation\u2019s debt[2]. However, others think that federal debt does matter because it negatively impacts the economy, reduces business investment and slows economic growth[3]. Additionally, rising debt increases expectations of higher rates of inflation, erodes confidence in the US dollar and misallocates capital[3]. Furthermore, people may not be aware of the effect the national debt has on their own lives and finances[5]."}
{"answer": "The general rule for title case is to capitalize all words except articles, prepositions and conjunctions[1][2][3][4]. However, some style guides may have different rules, such as The Associated Press would have you capitalize prepositions and conjunctions if they are four or more letters long[4], and others may have the magic number set at five[4]. Additionally, some style guides may also require that even short verbs be capitalized."}
{"answer": "Toothpaste works to clean headlights because it contains gentle abrasives that can help remove dust, dirt, grime, and light-dimming oxidation[1]. The ingredients in toothpaste make an effective headlight cleaning material[4], and it is also safe to use on plastic casings[2]. Another effective solution to clean headlights is a combination of vinegar and baking soda[2][5]."}
{"answer": "World War II veterans who were disabled were eligible for a wide variety of benefits, including disability compensation, pension, health care, home loans, insurance, vocational rehabilitation and employment, and burial[4]. In the United States, disability payments for wounded WW1 veterans would depend on the individual's circumstances. There is no set amount for all veterans. In Canada, a disability pension is provided to veterans who served in the Second World War or Korean War[3]."}
{"answer": "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Computers do not experience cognitive dissonance, which is the mental conflict that occurs when two ideas clash in our minds[3]. Cognitive dissonance is based on the idea that when two ideas are psychologically not consistent with each other, we change them and make them consistent[3][4]. It can interfere with our perceptions about ourselves and our abilities and is often uncomfortable and unpleasant[5]."}
{"answer": "Twitter is considered a reliable, relevant, and serious source for different things because it is a great way for journalists to connect with people and share newsworthy information from credible sources. Additionally, Twitter facilitates the discovery of news outlets and journalists and more than 80% of young journalists rely on Twitter for their jobs[5]. Traditional news media outlets are still essential because they provide reliable journalistic content, which forms the backbone of Twitter\u2019s links[3]. However, reliable, relevant, and serious news sources do not consider Twitter a reliable source for news, they only use it as a source for news leads and do their own reporting before publishing or even retweeting that information[2]."}
{"answer": "The association between mice and cheese is more of a myth than a fact. Mice are not actually particularly drawn to cheese because cheese isn't the type of food readily available in areas where mice usually live. Also, scientific studies have shown that mice tend to prefer foods with lots of sugar, while cheese consists of proteins that aren't usually sweet[2]. Furthermore, mice have very sensitive noses and the sharp, pungent smells of most cheeses would likely tend to drive them away rather than draw them near[5]. In fact, a study by Dr. David Holmes found that mice don't like cheese at all and even said that mice would turn to humans and other animals as a food source over the dairy option[4]."}
{"answer": "In tonal languages, speakers use intonation and pitch to convey various degrees of emotion. Tone is used in tonal languages to change the meaning of a word, not to convey questions or emotions[2][5]. In contrast, non-tonal languages such as English use tone to convey emotion or emphasis, but not to create meaning[2][3][5]. Tone is used to convey emotions such as fear, anger, confusion, or to emphasize something such as disagreement or contrast[5]."}
{"answer": "Investing in stocks means that you own a piece of a company that you buy a stock in. When corporations go public, they issue stock on an exchange and when investors buy this stock, they contribute funds to the company that helps them grow[1]. Stocks, shares and equities work by giving direct exposure to a company\u2019s performance[2]. You can invest in stocks by purchasing whole or fractional shares in companies, or by buying mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that invest in stocks[3]. Most investors own what\u2019s called common stock, which comes with voting rights, and may pay investors dividends[4]. As the company grows, you can expect the stock to deliver a return on your investment[5]."}
{"answer": "The key difference between bribery and lobbying is that bribes are meant to essentially buy a certain action from a person holding power, while lobbying does not necessarily guarantee a favorable outcome[1]. Bribery is considered illegal, while lobbying is not[3]. Bribes are given to an official directly for the purpose of guaranteeing a specific action, while lobbyists are hoping to gain influence over political figures, but they are not guaranteed any particular results[4]. Critics of lobbying suggest that it is bribery in a suit[5]. A bribe giver usually gives an offer of money \"under the table\" in order to subvert standard processes.[5]"}
{"answer": "The second postulate of special relativity states that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers in all inertial frames of reference, regardless of the motion of the light source. This postulate is in contrast to the first postulate which states that the laws of physics and electromagnetism are the same in any inertial frame of reference[4]. The second postulate has been argued to be too incidental and specific to play such a fundamental role in special relativity; some argue that it reduces special relativity to being a mere branch of electromagnetism, rather than a fundamental theory from which electromagnetism can actually be derived[5]. The derivations of the generalized Lorentz transformations seem to imply that the role of the second postulate in the theory of special relativity is merely the report of the numerical value of a free parameter, k, which appears in the equations[3][5]."}
{"answer": "Adhesives are substances that can hold materials together by surface attachment and can broadly be defined as liquids, solids, or pastes[3]. The stickiness of adhesives is due to their viscoelastic properties, meaning they exhibit some of the characteristics of liquids, and so they will 'wet' a surface to which they are pressed and then, because of their elasticity, they will resist separation when stressed[4]. Things like sugar or honey, which just feel kind of sticky, are down to forces that are not actually chemical bonds, but instead interactions between molecules[5]."}
{"answer": "The Universe is thought to be infinitely large and without an edge, so it doesn't have a center[1]. Therefore, no matter where you are in the Universe, you are always equidistant from the \"edges\" as it expands because space is expanding between all objects, creating more space in between them. This expansion has been happening for 18.9 Billion years, so it is impossible for us to reach the edge of the Universe even if we could travel at the speed of light[3]. The Universe is not like a ball, but rather it is like a flat grid, where the \"expansion\" just means that the distances between objects on the grid are getting larger[4]. That is why it is impossible for the Universe to have an end, as matter in the Universe is just getting farther apart[5]."}
{"answer": "Despite smoking having been banned from the skies for decades in most countries, ashtrays are still placed in or outside lavatories on planes[5]. This is because people will still try to break the rules and smoke on planes[2], and ashtrays provide a way to safely and properly dispose of cigarettes. Having ashtrays on planes is one of the many means to prevent fire hazards[4]."}
{"answer": "Humans generally get into cold water slowly and uncomfortably, because of the body's involuntary response to cold water shock[2][3], which is characterized by a sudden gasp, rapid breathing and increased heart rate and blood pressure. This response is even more extreme when your airways are underwater when you need to breathe, or if you suffer from an underlying heart or vascular condition[2]. With each exposure, the body adapts and the effects of cold water shock are reduced[3][4], but humans are tropical animals and have evolved to be comfortable in an ambient air temperature of about 28C[4], so cold water can still be a shock to the system. Furthermore, entering cold water too quickly can be dangerous for people who have a diagnosed or underlying heart condition[5]. In contrast, animals do not have the same physiological response to cold water and may be able to jump in with no hesitation."}
{"answer": "In general, a cyclone is any kind of circular wind storm, but now it is only used to describe a strong tropical storm found off the coast of India[4]. Hurricanes and typhoons are the same thing, but in different places[2][4]. Hurricanes occur in the Atlantic and typhoons occur in the Pacific[2][4]. Hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons are all types of tropical storms[1][2][4], and tropical cyclones that originate in the West are called hurricanes and tropical cyclones that originate in the East are called typhoons[2][4]. Tornadoes are different altogether\u2014they are funnel clouds that form from a storm over land (sometimes as part of a hurricane)[2][3][4]. Tornadoes are much smaller in scale than hurricanes[2][4]."}
{"answer": "The sudden urge to cough while using Q-Tips is caused by a phenomenon known as Arnold\u2019s ear-cough reflex, which is triggered when the external auditory canal is stimulated with a Q-tip[3]. This is an example of a biological glitch or mix-up, where the brain gets confused and mistakes contact in the ear for something in the throat, prompting you to cough in a misguided attempt to remove the irritant[5]. This phenomenon is common in both adults and children with chronic cough, but can occur in people without chronic cough as well[3]."}
{"answer": "Pregnant women are restricted from roller coasters, hot tubs, flights, etc. because such activities may cause health risks to the pregnant woman and the baby. Roller coasters and other thrill rides are marked with precaution signs suggesting who should not ride, including pregnant women. Additionally, amusement parks are good at identifying rides that pose risks to pregnant women and the safest course of action is to play it safe and avoid the rides that pose a risk[2]. Even some \"tamer\" rides, such as the Kilimanjaro Safari at the Animal Kingdom, may have warning notices for pregnant women because of the bumpy road surfaces and jarring movements of the jeep[3]. Furthermore, Disney, Six Flags, Busch Gardens, and even local state fairs all pose warning signs not to ride certain rides during pregnancy, even though there are no studies documenting that they are safe[5]."}
{"answer": "Cell phone towers are often disguised to blend into their surroundings in order to maintain the aesthetic integrity of communities and reduce the visual impact of the masts[4]. This is required by municipalities in many cases[3] and is a way to ensure the masts are accepted by local residents and communities. One common method of disguising mobile phone masts is to build them into existing structures, such as the rooftops of buildings or the sides of bridges[2][4]. In some cases, cell towers are disguised as pine and palm trees to blend into the environment[5]."}
{"answer": "In solitary songwriting or sole writing, one person is responsible for creating the entire music and lyrics of a song[4]. According to Billboard, 44% of the songs that reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart during the 1970s were written by just one songwriter[4]. Lionel Richie and Diane Warren are the only songwriters with at least 8 number-one singles written solely by themselves[4]."}
{"answer": "Svartifoss waterfall has square-shaped basalt columns because the hexagonal basalt columns were created when lava cooled very slowly so that the molten rock could crystallize[4]. This can be seen in the design of many Icelandic architectures, such as the National Theatre building and the Hallgr\u00edmskirkja church in Reykjavik[4]. The waterfall is surrounded by dark lava columns and looks like an church organ[4]."}
{"answer": "Bosnia and Herzegovina is a parliamentary representative democracy with a three-member Presidency and a bi-cameral legislature consisting of the House of the People and the House of Representatives[2][4]. It has a Constitutional Court that is the country\u2019s highest judicial body[1][4]. There are classic checks and balances in place, such as the parliament\u2019s power to adopt a no-confidence vote against the government, and the government\u2019s right to dissolve parliament[1]. The book referenced in Refrence  provides an introduction to the basics of Bosnian political structure, institutions, and political processes[3][5]."}
{"answer": "Recent data breaches have been caused by a variety of factors. In April 2021, Facebook was hacked and their database was leaked on the dark web for free[1]. Hackers also stole the details of 617 million online accounts from 16 hacked websites, including Dubsmash, MyHeritage, Whitepages, Fotolog, BookMate, CoffeeMeetsBagel, HauteLook, and DataCamp[2]. The biggest data breach in history is the Yahoo! Data Breach[3]. In Ukraine, a volunteer \u2018global cyber army\u2019 hacked several Russian websites and leaked more than 1600 Russian soldiers\u2019 personal information and other data[4]. In late March 2021, Apple and Meta were caught out by hackers pretending to be law enforcement officials and provided them with customer addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses[5]."}
{"answer": "Depression is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors[1][2][3][4]. It is thought that as many as 40 percent of those with depression can trace it to a genetic link[4]. Genetic factors may combine with environmental and other factors to increase the risk of developing depression[2][4]. It is also possible that in some cases, the tendency to become depressed is almost completely genetic, and in other cases it is not really genetic at all[1]. Although depression is more common in people whose family members have depression, this does not mean that one simply \u201cinherits\u201d depression from their mother or father[3]."}
{"answer": "If you were quiet for years, you may experience a greater sense of balance and insight into everything you do[2]. You may also be able to relax more in natural spaces and appreciate the environment without the clatter of human existence[3]. However, diving straight into a ten-day silent retreat might not be the best approach and may have the opposite effect[1]. It is not known for certain what would happen if you went without speaking for a long time, but it might be best to slowly introduce small pockets of silence into your day-to-day life to get used to it.[3]"}
{"answer": "SMPTE timecode is a set of cooperating standards to label individual frames of video or film with a timecode[3]. It is presented in hour:minute:second:frame format and is typically represented in 32 bits using binary-coded decimal[1]. It is defined by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers in the SMPTE 12M specification[3]. There are also drop-frame and color framing flags and three extra binary group flag bits used for defining the use of the user bits[1]. Other varieties of SMPTE timecode can include extra information in a variety of encodings[1]. It is also used to create a control track longitudinal timecode (CTL timecode), which is SMPTE timecode embedded in the control track of a video tape[5]."}
{"answer": "Yes, imaginary numbers can be represented visually. They can be represented as a pair of numbers (a, b) forming a vector on a diagram called an Argand diagram, representing the complex plane[3]. Additionally, they can be thought of as vectors and can be calculated with using all our rules for manipulating vectors[2]. Imaginary numbers can also model anything that rotates between two dimensions \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d[4], or anything with a cyclic, circular relationship[4]."}
