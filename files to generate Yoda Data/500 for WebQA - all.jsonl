{"question": "in football whats the point of wasting the first two plays with a rush - up the middle - not regular rush plays i get those", "answer": "The point of wasting the first two plays with a rush up the middle is to take advantage of the 40 second play clock and the two minute warning in professional and college football games. By running the ball directly up the middle, the offense hopes to be able to block everyone up and the running back can make a person miss and end up in the end zone[2]. Running up the middle is also the shortest path to the end zone, so it is often designed to move defensive players out of the way[3]. Additionally, running the ball up the middle enough times will cause linebackers and defensive backs to run toward the line of scrimmage, creating the perfect opportunity to throw the ball over their heads or in vacated areas[4]. This strategy is used to keep possession of the ball as long as possible rather than attempting to score[2][5].", "references": ["As you can see from these highlights, most of these plays are designed to be run directly up the middle. The coach hopes everyone can be blocked up; the running back can make a person miss and ultimately end up in the end zone.", "In both professional and college football, the offense has 40 seconds from the end of the previous play to run the next play. A team running out the clock will allow the play clock (which records the time remaining until a play must be run) to drain as much as possible before running its next play. In the NFL, this is particularly noteworthy due to the existence of the two-minute warning. If the trailing team has no timeouts remaining and the leading team is in possession of the ball with a first down at the two-minute warning, they can effectively run out the clock and win the game without running another positive play. With two minutes to go (120 seconds), the offense can take three \"knees\", one each on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd down (using all 40 seconds from the play clock on each), and allow the game clock to expire before having to run a play for fourth down. A similar situation can be had by also achieving a first down inside the two-minute warning. This practice is commonly known as the \"Victory Formation\", as the offense lines up in a tightly-protective \"V\" formation to minimize the chances of a fumble or other turnover.", "Running backs run up the middle because it\u2019s the shortest path to the end zone. Plays are often designed to move defensive players out of the way so the running back can run straight as fast as he can. The defense does a great job of getting off blocks or disrupting the running back\u2019s path and creating a pile more often than not.", "If you run the football enough times up the middle, linebackers and defensive backs will start to run toward the line of scrimmage. This is the perfect opportunity to throw the ball over their heads or in vacated areas.", "Time-wasting in association football consists of two forms, extending the length of stoppages when the ball is out of play, and, while the ball is in play, playing in a way as to keep possession of the ball as long as possible rather than attempting to score."]}
{"question": "Why are different tiers (regular < mid < premium) of gas' prices almost always 10 cents different?", "answer": "The 10 cent difference between the different tiers of gas prices is likely due to a convention established by gas stations, which is likely done to make the prices easier for customers to understand and remember.

Some energy from the microwaves sort of dances around on the surface of whatever metal you stuck in the oven. Some of it is reflected off the surface of the metal and bounces off it, like a reflection in a mirror. That doesn\u2019t mean metal can\u2019t get hot; it can. It contains electrons that are attracted to the microwaves, too; only, without something to efficiently absorb the energy this attraction produces (i.e., food), it transfers it to whatever\u2019s nearby\u2014namely, the internal circuitry of your oven, resulting in overheating and possibly fire.

{"question": "If the ozone layer is made up of O3, why are we not producing some of it ourselves and pumping more of them into the atmosphere to fix the problem faster?", "answer": "It is not possible to produce O3 and pump it into the atmosphere to fix the problem faster because O3 molecules in the stratosphere are constantly being produced and destroyed by different types of UV radiation from the sun[2]. These UV radiation cause certain chemicals to break apart and release chlorine or bromine atoms, which in turn destroy ozone molecules[2]. The oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecules to form more ozone[2][3]. This reaction is also catalysed by the presence of certain free radicals, such as hydroxyl, nitric oxide and atomic chlorine and bromine[5]. The increase of CFCs and similar chlorinated and brominated organic molecules in the atmosphere has caused stratospheric ozone concentrations to decline, which is why the 1987 Montreal Protocol was created to ban the production of many ozone depleting chemicals[5].", "references": ["Forty years ago, scientists warned that a hole in the layer of ozone surrounding the earth could have serious effects on human health and the environment.

A crucial moment in the crisis arrived on October 24, when Soviet ships bound for Cuba neared the line of U.S. vessels enforcing the blockade, which could have sparked a military confrontation that could have quickly escalated to a nuclear exchange[2]. The tumultuous U.S.-Cuba relationship had its roots in the Cold War and was a result of the U.S. severing diplomatic ties with Cuba, pursuing covert operations to overthrow the Fidel Castro regime, and instituting a full economic embargo in 1961[3][4]. The Cuban missile crisis strengthened Kennedy\u2019s image domestically and internationally and may have helped mitigate negative world opinion regarding the failed Bay of Pigs invasion[5]. It also resulted in the establishment of a direct telephone link between the White House and the Kremlin, known as the \u201cHotline\u201d, and the beginnings of a nuclear Test Ban Treaty.[1][5]", "references": ["The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 was a direct and dangerous confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War and was the moment when the two superpowers came closest to nuclear conflict.

After the Cuban Revolution, the United States recognized Fidel Castro\u2019s government but began imposing economic penalties as the new regime increased its trade with the Soviet Union, nationalized American-owned properties, and hiked taxes on U.S. imports. After slashing Cuban sugar imports, Washington instituted a ban on nearly all U.S. exports to Cuba, which President John F. Kennedy expanded into a full economic embargo that included stringent travel restrictions.", "The Cuban missile crisis stands as a singular event during the Cold War and strengthened Kennedy\u2019s image domestically and internationally.

First, despite the flurry of direct and indirect communications between the White House and the Kremlin\u2014perhaps because of it\u2014Kennedy and Khrushchev, and their advisers, struggled throughout the crisis to clearly understand each others\u2019 true intentions, while the world hung on the brink of possible nuclear war. In an effort to prevent this from happening again, a direct telephone link between the White House and the Kremlin was established; it became known as the \u201cHotline.\u201d Second, having approached the brink of nuclear conflict, both superpowers began to reconsider the nuclear arms race and took the first steps in agreeing to a nuclear Test Ban Treaty."]}
{"question": "How do you build a Nanorobot..?", "answer": "Building a nanorobot typically involves using a nanorobotic manufacturing system such as \u03bcRobotex, which uses a robotically operated ion gun, housed in a large vacuum chamber, to shoot out a focusing ion beam (FIB)[1]. Additionally, one can build pixel nanobots by setting all the empty pixels to gray and then setting a one pixel at a random location to one of 16 basic colors with RGB code notation, which can create more than 65,000 individual nanobots[2].

{"question": "If a self-driving car detects multiple courses of action (all of which will likely result in human injury) how will it determine which course to take?", "answer": "Self-driving cars use a combination of sensor inputs, speed, and other information to calculate the most likely consequences of different trajectories and determine which course of action to take[2]. To make this decision, the car must consider the risk of fatality, the potential of the truck-driver to react and prevent the accident, and other factors[1][2][4]. As seen in the Uber accident of 2018, when self-driving cars fail to detect potential hazards or make incorrect decisions, the consequences can be fatal. As such, self-driving cars should not be given the right to choose their own accident-algorithms, as this would complicate coordination and compromise safety[5].", "references": ["Consider now the following scenario.Footnote 3 A self-driving car with five passengers approaches a conventional car (e.g. a heavy truck) that for some reason suddenly departs from its lane and heads directly towards the self-driving car. In a split-second, the self-driving car senses the trajectory and the likely weight of the oncoming truck. It calculates that a high-impact collision is inevitable, which would kill the five passengers, unless the car swerves towards the pavement on its right-hand side. There, unfortunately, an elderly pedestrian happens to be walking, and he will die as a result if the self-driving car swerves to the right and hits him. This is the sort of situation in which the human passengers of a self-driving car cannot take control quickly enough. So the car itself needs to respond to the situation at hand. And in order for the five passengers in the self-driving car to be saved, as they are likely to be if the head-on collision with the heavy truck is avoided, the car here needs to make a maneuver that will most likely kill one person.", "This has certain advantages. A self-driving car will not react in the panicky and disorganized ways a human being is apt to react to accident-scenarios. Even in situations of unavoidable collisions, the car\u2019s technology enables significant choices and control-levels regarding how to crash. Based on its sensor inputs and the other information it has access to, the car can calculate the most likely consequences of different trajectories that involve different combinations of braking and swerving.", "This problem was evident in a fatal accident in March 2018, which involved an autonomous car operated by Uber. The company reported that the vehicle's software identified a pedestrian but deemed it a false positive and failed to swerve to avoid hitting her. This crash caused Toyota to temporarily cease its testing of self-driving cars on public roads, but its testing will continue elsewhere. The Toyota Research Institute is constructing a test facility on a 60-acre site in Michigan to further develop automated vehicle technology.", "First, the self-driving car cannot acquire certain knowledge about the truck\u2019s trajectory, its speed at the time of collision, and its actual weight. This creates uncertainty because each of these factors has a strong causal influence on the fatality risk for the passengers of the self-driving car. (Berends 2009; Evans 2001) Moreover, the truck-driver might try to prevent the accident by steering back to her lane. Or if it\u2019s already too late, she might start braking just half a second before the crash (thereby significantly reducing the truck\u2019s speed and impact). The self-driving car\u2019s software can only work with estimates of these alternative courses of events.Footnote 11", "8. Jason Millar argues that the accident-algorithms of self-driving cars ought to be selected by the owner of the car. (Millar 2014) This would mean that different cars could have different accident-algorithms. Two comments: firstly, this would still require a mutual decision since the basic decision to give owners of self-driving cars the right to choose their accident-algorithms would need to be agreed upon by the various different stakeholders involved. Second, this seems undesirable since different accident-algorithms in different cars would complicate coordination and compromise safety."]}

One is that gas station owners worry that when the wholesale price of gas they pay drops, there is no assurance the price won\u2019t again rise, so they wait until they see a trend in oil prices[1]. Another explanation is that when oil prices rapidly increase, the full increase is not always passed on to consumers[5].

{"question": "Why does charge build up in a cloud?", "answer": "Charge builds up in a cloud due to the friction of colliding droplets of water and ice, as well as freezing[2]. The friction of colliding droplets of water and ice knocks off electrons, leaving the rising water droplets positively charged, while the electrons gather near the bottom of the cloud, producing a negative charge. As water droplets rise, they encounter colder air temperatures and start to freeze, with the frozen portion of the droplet tending to acquire a negative charge, and the unfrozen portion tending to acquire a positive charge[2]. As the static charge buildup in the storm cloud increases, the electric field surrounding the cloud becomes stronger and can ionize the surrounding air and make it more conductive, allowing for charge transfer from the cloud to the ground or to other clouds[5].", "references": ["Within the cloud the charges move in a random manner. However, they are constrained to their charge regions. The positive charges do not try to reach the negatives nor vice versa. In this way the charge separation and electric field strength is maintained. Occasionally charge may dissipate from the cloud. While the actual mechanism for this dissipation is also unknown, it is illustrated in this model by precipitation in the same manner as the charge buildup. Charge leaves the cloud at a rate specified by the PRECIPITATION-RATE slider. When the EVAPORATION-RATE equals the PRECIPITATION-RATE the strength of ELECTRIC-FIELD will remain fairly constant.", "How a charge becomes charged is still an area of active research, but we do know that the top of the cloud becomes positively charged while the bottom of the cloud becomes negatively charged. Two processes that play a role in creating this charge separation are the friction of colliding droplets of water and ice in the cloud and freezing. As the millions and millions of water droplets and ice particles whirl about in the cloud, they collide with rising moisture and in the process knock off electrons (negatively charged particles), leaving the rising water droplets positively charged. The knocked off electrons gather near the bottom of the cloud producing a negative charge, while the positively charged droplets rise toward the top of the cloud. As water droplets rise, they encounter colder air temperatures and start to freeze. The frozen portion of the droplet tends to acquire a negative charge while the unfrozen portion tends to acquire a positive charge. Air currents can rip off the liquid portion of the water droplet and carry it to the top of the cloud while the frozen portion falls toward the bottom of the cloud. Thus the cloud becomes even more polarized (positive charge at the top, negative charge at the bottom).", "I am curious what causes the charge build up in a cloud before lightning occurs. I have seen in a few places such as this, that the process is not fully understood. Is this some form of static electricity? Here are a few of my thoughts:", "- If the charge buildup is caused by static electricity which two surfaces are contacting to create the charge? Is this just rain and ice particles? Can it be something else? (I think I recall something about lightning storms without rain in the desert) Why do some clouds with lightning have rain and others do not if the rain drops are the source of the static?", "As the static charge buildup in a storm cloud increases, the electric field surrounding the cloud becomes stronger. Normally, the air surrounding a cloud would be a good enough insulator to prevent a discharge of electrons to Earth. Yet, the strong electric fields surrounding a cloud are capable of ionizing the surrounding air and making it more conductive. The ionization involves the shredding of electrons from the outer shells of gas molecules. The gas molecules that compose air are thus turned into a soup of positive ions and free electrons. The insulating air is transformed into a conductive plasma. The ability of a storm cloud's electric fields to transform air into a conductor makes charge transfer (in the form of a lightning bolt) from the cloud to the ground (or even to other clouds) possible."]}
{"question": "the hypothetical turtle on an island in the sun question?", "answer": "Sea turtles are able to find their way back to their natal areas, even if they are located on islands, through a combination of geomagnetic imprinting and magnetic navigation[2]. Studies have shown that juvenile turtles are able to use magnetic navigation to move towards distant goals[3], and that they are able to create a \"magnetic map\" of their natal area to use for navigation[2][3][5]. This suggests that, even if a hypothetical turtle was placed on a remote island in the sun, it would be able to use a combination of magnetic imprinting and navigation to find its way back home.[1]", "references": ["In principle, finding an island using a single magnetic element such as inclination or intensity is possible, inasmuch as a turtle might follow an isoline that intersects the island or passes nearby (Lohmann et al., 2007). Thus, a combination of geomagnetic imprinting and magnetic navigation similar to that outlined previously for continental nesting sites might suffice in some cases. Alternatively or additionally, a more complex strategy, such as imprinting on two elements of the field and using some form of bi-coordinate magnetic navigation, might also be feasible in some situations (Lohmann et al., 1999, 2007, 2008a). Simulations have indicated that a strategy of using magnetic navigation to arrive in the vicinity of an island, and then using chemical cues to pinpoint it, is plausible even for very small, remote islands, and even when significant secular variation occurs (Endres et al., 2016). Additional environmental cues such as the sound of waves breaking or the pattern of waves refracting around an island might also help turtles locate islands once they have drawn near (Lohmann et al., 1999, 2008c).", "Although most beaches with large numbers of nesting sea turtles are located along continental coastlines, some turtle populations nest on islands. From an evolutionary perspective, island-nesting populations are thought to be derived from turtles that originally nested on continents (Bowen and Karl, 2007). Whether turtles in the two groups use the same mechanisms to locate their natal areas is not known. Alternative strategies of navigation and imprinting might have evolved to facilitate island nesting; indeed, the mechanisms used by any population to return to a natal area might depend in part on what is effective in a particular geographic setting (Lohmann et al., 2007, 2008a).", "A particularly convincing demonstration that turtles can use magnetic navigation to move toward a distant goal has come from experiments with juvenile green turtles. Turtles of this age show fidelity to coastal feeding sites and return to them after seasonal migrations or experimental displacements (Ireland, 1980; Avens et al., 2003; Avens and Lohmann, 2004). Juvenile turtles were tethered to a tracking system inside a pool of water located on land but very close to their offshore feeding area on the Atlantic coast of Florida (Lohmann et al., 2004). Turtles were then exposed to magnetic fields that exist at locations 340 km north or south of the feeding site. Individuals exposed to the northern field swam south, whereas those exposed to the southern field swam north (Fig. 3). Thus, turtles behaved as if they were trying to return home from the locations where the two fields actually exist. These findings imply that, well before the turtles mature, they have already acquired a \u2018magnetic map\u2019 (Lohmann et al., 2007) that can be used for navigation toward distant coastal locations.", "Additional evidence that nesting female turtles seek out magnetic signatures has emerged from studies of population genetics (Shamblin et al., 2011; Lohmann et al., 2013; Brothers and Lohmann, 2018). Analyses have revealed that loggerhead turtles that nest at similar latitudes but on opposite sides of the Florida peninsula are often genetically similar despite their geographic distance from each other (Shamblin et al., 2011). Given that the magnetic fields at latitudinally similar locations on opposite sides of Florida are similar, an interesting possibility is that this population structure has arisen as a consequence of errors in magnetic navigation during natal homing (Shamblin et al., 2011; Lohmann et al., 2013). In other words, if turtles seek out the magnetic signature of their natal beach, but sometimes mistakenly nest on a different beach with a similar magnetic signature, then the genetic pattern can be readily explained. Consistent with this possibility, some loggerhead turtles nest in widely separated locations during their lifetimes, including sites on both the east and west coasts of Florida (Bjorndal et al., 1983).", "Evidence for a magnetic map in green turtles.

{"question": "Why do we have two small nostrils and not one larger nostril?", "answer": "We have two small nostrils instead of one larger nostril for several reasons. Firstly, having two nostrils gives us stereoscopic smell, which means we can detect more scents and smells than if we just had one nostril. Secondly, two nostrils offer less resistance to airflow than a single large nostril, which helps us filter and condition the air we breathe[2]. Thirdly, we have something called the nasal cycle, where we predominantly breathe through one nostril at a time, and the other side becomes congested and rests[3]. Fourthly, the nostrils are separated by the septum, which can sometimes be deviated, causing one nostril to appear larger than the other[1][4]. And finally, the airflow between both nostrils is not always equal, with one nostril allowing more air to pass through than the other[1][2][5].", "references": ["Two eyes, two ears, two nostrils. We need our doubles for stereoscopic vision, stereo sound, and super smelling. Our nostrils are separated by a septum, in effect giving us two noses. Most of the time, one nostril allows less air to pass through than the other, with the nasal flow switching every few hours. The slower airflow is caused by the tissue inside swelling with increased blood flow.", "But why do we have two noses? Is it because we are bilaterally symmetrical with two arms, two legs, two of most organs? Could one nostril be more beautiful and function better? Surely a single large nostril placed in the centre of the face could function as effectively as is the case for the mouth where one opening serves us very well. It could take us a little while to appreciate the beauty of a single nostril as opposed to the beauty of our paired and smaller nostrils but I feel this would grow on us, especially us physiologists, as a single large nostril would have better aerodynamics and offer less resistance to airflow than our two smaller nostrils. The nose does present a considerable resistance to airflow- around two thirds of the resistance to airflow of the whole airway from nostril to alveoli. Most of the work of breathing is related to moving air through the nose and this is the price we pay for filtering and conditioning the air we breathe.", "Another reason we have two nostrils is because of something called the \"nasal cycle\". While we don't consciously notice it, we breathe predominantly through one nostril at a time, and the other side becomes a bit congested and rests. You can test this yourself: try breathing through one nostril and then the other, and you'll probably find that one becomes stuffier than the other. This automatically changes over about four to six hours, so then the other side relaxes.", "The nostrils are separated by the septum. The septum can sometimes be deviated, causing one nostril to appear larger than the other. With extreme damage to the septum and columella, the two nostrils are no longer separated and form a single larger external opening.", "The airflow between both nostrils is not always equal. The air flowing into one nostril is often greater than the other due to a process known as the nasal cycle. Therefore, a person may feel they are breathing more through one nostril than the other."]}

Nobody knows how they will react in that situation until it happens. Often, victims report feeling frozen with shock. Sometimes it isn't safe to respond.

{"question": "What is fake meat made of and how do they get the texture to be so similar to real meat?", "answer": "Fake meat is often made from plant proteins such as soy, wheat gluten, and tofu[2][4]. The texture of fake meat is achieved by breaking down the proteins and reshaping them with a food extruder or by using wet extrusion processes[4]. Lastly, food manufacturers season the faux meat to mimic the flavors and textures of real meat[3].", "references": ["Fake meat is often associated with a tough, flavorless texture that is added to dishes to provide protein.

When we say we love meat are we really talking about a set of nutrients? A certain flavour or texture? Or a set of cultural memories of shared meals such as Christmas turkey and Easter lamb?

And this is where the huge and ever-growing enthusiasm for fake meat becomes somewhat tricky.", "On their own, any unflavored meat alternative won't have the taste of actual animal flesh, but once food manufacturers have achieved that meaty texture, they can season the faux meat to mimic anything from hot dogs and ribs to steak and calamari.", "Texture plays a big role in determining whether a product tastes like real meat or not. For example, the satisfyingly stringy texture one gets from pulling apart chicken strips. Fortunately, food scientists have found ways to emulate the fibrous quality in fake meat using soy protein. Soy protein is initially globular, so it must be denatured, or broken down, to make it more fibrous. Soy protein is first exposed to heat, solvent, or acid, before it is reshaped with a food extruder . Extrusion processes are useful as they can form meat analogs with fibrous matrices, which can then be rehydrated into meat like substances . However, this process can sometimes result in a dry product. The rising company Beyond Meat has gone further and found a way to use soy flour, pea flour, carrot fiber, and gluten-free flour to emulate the fibrous quality in their fake meat with a wet extrusion process. The proteins are realigned and then locked in position by crosslinking to get a fibrous chicken imitation that is also moist and juicy .", "Last but not least, taste is a significant factor in why people eat fake meat.

{"question": "If you have no sense of taste can you feel the heat/spiciness from something like a pepper?", "answer": "No, if you have no sense of taste, you cannot feel the heat or spiciness from something like a pepper. The heat or spiciness from the pepper is not a taste, but rather a neurological response caused by the pepper's membrane releasing capsaicin, a chemical compound that clamps onto your mouth's neurotransmitters, which regulate temperature[1].

In fact, when you eat spicy food, you\u2019re not burning your tongue at all\u2014you\u2019re a victim of a neurological response.

These are the same receptors that would tell the roof of your mouth, say, that it was being burned from a bite of scorching hot brick-oven pizza, but in the spicy food scenario, the receptors falsely alert you that you\u2019re literally burning your mouth. These receptors exist all over your body, which also explains why you have a burning sensation on your fingers after chopping serrano peppers (or in your eyes if you absentmindedly rub them). But, according to Keith Cadwallader, a professor at the University of Illinois, there\u2019s no damage to any tissue itself: The interaction is simply a signal that our brains interpret as a blast of heat.

I wrote about this question on The Guardian\u2019s science blog last year. Spiciness, in fact, has nothing to do with sweetness or salt or sourness. Spicy is an abbreviation for pain. The sensation of spiciness is produced when pain receptors are activated in the tongue. Capsaicin is a member of the vanilloid family of molecules, and it binds to a receptor on the tongue.

While the water in the air and in the clouds is fresh water, it is widely dispersed and is hard to collect. Humans must therefore wait for the water in the oceans to evaporate into the atmosphere and then rain or snow back down to the ground. The places near or on the surface where rainwater and snowmelt collect are the places that constitute the human-usable portion of the water cycle. These places include freshwater rivers, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and groundwater.", "Parents, city officials, and environmentalists seem to be often telling us, \"Don't waste water!\" and \"Conserve water!\". By these statements they typically mean that we shouldn't leave the faucet on needlessly, should fix all the plumbing leaks right away, and should only use water sparingly. At the same time, our science teachers tell us that all of the water on the earth is part of an ongoing global water cycle. They tell us that water that goes down the drain does not get destroyed. Rather, it just moves on to the ocean and on to the next part of the water cycle. There seems to be a contradiction between these two positions. How can we \"waste\" water, if it just continues on in the water cycle and inevitably makes its way back for us to use again?"]}

{"question": "Why does Basic Income Decrease \"Werkgelegenheid\" and is this the same metric as \"Job Opportunities\"?", "answer": "Implementing a substantial basic income has been argued to reduce \"werkgelegenheid\" (employment) in order to improve labour market flexibility, boost low wage employment and part-time work[1]. This is because workers may not find jobs that suit their skills due to the lack of work experience and/or difficulties signaling their skills, which may cause their reservation wages to be higher than wage offers they receive[2]. Additionally, research has found that payroll subsidies for manual workers, such as the Finnish payroll subsidy for older, low-wage workers, can reduce hours of work and hourly earnings[3]. Other studies have also found that increases in the minimum wage reduce employment, but found no evidence of increased employment when the payroll tax subsidy was increased[4]. Finally, there is evidence that the employment effects of wage subsidies persist long after the subsidy expires, as it increases workers' lifetime earnings[4][5]. \"Job opportunities\" is a different metric, which refers to the percentage of people who are actively seeking a job who are able to find one.", "references": ["Basic income is a regularly debated topic in various scholarly disciplines (political philosophy, political theory, welfare economics, labour market economics and social policy) and in circles of policy makers, administrators and activists. Since the late 1970s, unemployment is the primary problem for social-economic policy in all welfare states. In Basic Income, Unemployment and Compensatory Justice it is argued that implementing a substantial basic income is the best policy response to deal with unemployment-induced problems such as job insecurity, social exclusion, poverty and lack of compensatory justice on the labour market and to improve labour market flexibility, boost low wage employment and part-time work. Basic Income, Unemployment and Compensatory Justice, with an introductory chapter by Philippe van Parijs, discusses the attractiveness of a substantial basic income to deal with the problem of unemployment, in combination with an ethical perspective of social justice.", "In summary, at any level of human capital, workers might not find jobs that suit their skills/diplomas because of the lack of work experience and/or difficulties signaling these skills (long-term unemployment can also bring observed skills below their potential6). Their reservation wages are likely to be higher than the wage offers they receive to compensate for their learning needs. In part, this is because lower productivity jobs could pay more. But other factors (not taken into account in our simple model) such as family support or expectations about fair wages for a given set of skills can also increase reservation wages. Workers would then prefer to wait and remain unemployed seeking for better job offers, or eventually settle in lower productivity jobs where there would be less learning7. Clearly, one can argue that rational individuals would understand that they are better off over the long term by taking the higher productivity jobs and accepting the lower wages. They could, for instance, borrow to help support the period of on the job training at low pay and then repay the loan when their salaries increase. But even if individuals had the right foresight, access to credit is often not an option, particularly, among worker with no job history or who have been through long periods of unemployment.", "Goos and Konings (2007) also used firm data to evaluate the payroll subsidies for manual workers in Belgium, and found significant effects on employment. A careful analysis of the Finnish payroll subsidy for older, low-wage workers by Huttunen et al. (2010) found mixed results: the subsidy had no significant effect on employment or the probability of leaving a job, but produced a 2 percent increase in the hours of work for employees in the industrial sector (but not the service sector) by increasing the probability that a part-time worker would become full-time by 7 percent. At the same time, the subsidy reduced hourly earnings of industrial workers by 2 percent, just offsetting the effect of the increase in hours on earnings.", "There have been several evaluations of the French system, in which payroll taxes are reduced for low-wage workers; the subsidy is phased out as wages rise. Using household data, Kramarz and Philippon (2001) compared workers affected by changes in the minimum wage or the payroll tax subsidy when those policies changed with workers just above that level. They found that increases in the minimum wage reduced employment, but found no evidence of increased employment when the payroll tax subsidy was increased. Crepon and Desplatz (2002) used firm data to estimate the effects of different levels of the payroll tax on total employment at the firm level. They found that larger subsidies were indeed correlated with faster growth in total employment (in cross-section), but their data did not allow them to distinguish between growth in low-wage jobs and growth in high-wage jobs.", "Most of these studies do not distinguish between the employment effects while the wage subsidy is being received, as predicted by the static model, and the longer-term employment effects generated by greater work experience and, therefore, higher productivity, as predicted by the dynamic model discussed in the previous section. However, the studies cited earlier, by Orr et al. (1996), Bell et al. (1999), strongly imply that the employment effects of wage subsidies persist long after the subsidy expires. In another study Heckman et al. (2002) posit a model of \u201clearning by doing\u201d in which time spent working increases human capital and contrast it with a model of \u201con-the-job training\u201d, which entails a tradeoff between working and training and, therefore, forgone earnings. Using changes in earnings induced by changes in the structure of the U.S. Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), they show that under a model of learning by doing, the EITC increases workers\u2019 lifetime earnings, whereas under the formal training model, the EITC actually reduces earnings, once the tradeoff between work and training is taken into account14."]}

{"question": "What's the difference between Genetic Drift and Natural Selection?", "answer": "The primary difference between natural selection and genetic drift is that natural selection is a process where more adaptive species are selected in response to environmental challenges, while genetic drift is a random selection[1][4]. Natural selection is usually driven as a response to an organism's environmental challenges[1][3], while genetic drift is completely random and based on luck[3][4]. Natural selection is not random and represents only positive change/adaptation[4], while genetic drift can have helpful, detrimental, or no effect.

{"question": "Why do professional athletes have a significantly lower pulse than the average person ?", "answer": "Professional athletes have a significantly lower pulse than the average person because exercise strengthens the heart muscle, enabling it to pump a greater volume of blood with each heartbeat. This means that more oxygen gets delivered to the muscles, so the heart needs to beat fewer times than it would in a less-fit person while at rest[4]. It is also thought to be due to intrinsic changes within the heart, such as the down-regulation of the HCN4 gene[5]. However, a low resting heart rate should not be taken lightly and may be accompanied by dizziness, fainting, or illness, in which case you should consult a medical professional[1].", "references": ["Endurance athletes will have lower resting heart rates than the general population.

An athlete\u2019s resting heart rate is usually only considered too low when they\u2019re experiencing symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, and weakness.", "Endurance athletes and other people who exercise a great deal often have lower-than-average heart rates, sometimes even below 40 beats per minute. Exercise strengthens the heart muscle, enabling it to pump a greater volume of blood with each heartbeat. More oxygen gets delivered to the muscles, so the heart needs to beat fewer times than it would in a less-fit person while at rest.", "The reasons athletes have slow heart rates are not well understood. Traditionally changes in neural input (vagal tone) were thought to lead to bradycardia in athletes. However, several studies have demonstrated that even after blocking these inputs (autonomic blockade), athletes continue to have lower heart rates than non-athletes. The reasons for this are not known however recent research using athlete mice models suggests this is due to intrinsic changes within the heart by down-regulation of the HCN4 gene. In the mouse model, the medication which blocks this gene, ivabradine, helped to equalise the heart rates in athlete and non-athlete mice."]}

{"question": "How do landlords make money", "answer": "Landlords make money from rental properties in several ways. First, they collect rent from tenants, and what's left in the pot after covering expenses gives them an income[1]. Second, landlords bank on the rental property appreciating in long-term value and cash out the equity when they sell or refinance[1].

Simply put, this is the difference between the rent collected and all operating expenses.", "We have been focused on apartments for over 30 years and do take in hundreds of thousands in rent - but we sure don't get to keep hundreds. Landlords make decent money by working hard and sticking with it for long long periods of time, just like many other occupations.", "1. Professional landlords are investors who evaluate the potential dollar return of a property before deciding whether to buy. One financial marker is the capitalization, or cap rate. The cap rate is the ratio between the property's net income and the value of the property. For example, if your landlord buys a property for $100,000 and collects $10,000 in annual rent after deducting his costs, his cap rate is 10 percent. Property values go up and down over time. By keeping an eye on his cap rate, your landlord is able to determine the best time to sell and invest the proceeds elsewhere.", "Now, most landlords don't pay 100% of the house price. They pay, say, 20% or so. The rest is covered by a mortgage (i.e., bank loan) and then the rental income pays off the loan, the other expenses on the house, and leaves some cash leftover.... note that not all properties are profitable as rental, but the good ones are cash-flow positive from day one."]}
{"question": "How have wolves impacted Yellowstone?", "answer": "The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone has had a mostly positive overall impact on the ecosystem, including on both small and large species, as well as on plant life[2]. Wolves have impacted the ecosystem by changing the feeding habits of elk, which has likely contributed to the rebound of the beaver population in the area[3]. However, it is difficult to accurately measure the full extent of the wolves' impact due to the complexity of nature and the limited funding for long-term research[4].", "references": ["Since 1995, wolves in Yellowstone have been tracked and studied, while the impact on plant and animal life could now be quantified.

It is believed that they chose these systems because 60 is a superior highly composite number with twelve factors and is the lowest common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6[5]. This makes it easier to divide into sections, as one hour can be divided evenly into sections of 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 12 minutes, 10 minutes, 6 minutes, 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute[5].", "references": ["Less obvious is the reason for using the number 60, a number still widely used today with 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes of arc in one degree of angle and six times that number of degrees, 360, in a circle.", "The use of 60 began with the Sumerians who used different number systems. While you and I write numbers using base 10, or \u201cdecimal\u201d this civilization used base 12 (\"duodecimal\") and base 60 (\"sexigesimal\"). It is not known exactly why they chose these systems, but there are a few theories:", "The hour is a legal unit of time and describes the twenty-fourth part of a day. But why is an hour divided into 60 minutes? Wouldn't it be much easier if an hour had 10 \"deci-hours\" and 100 \"centi-hours\" (instead of 60 minutes and 3,600 seconds)? How do we come up with the number 60?", "Sexagesimal, also known as base 60 or sexagenary, is a numeral system with sixty as its base. It originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, was passed down to the ancient Babylonians, and is still used\u2014in a modified form\u2014for measuring time, angles, and geographic coordinates.", "The number 60, a superior highly composite number, has twelve factors, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60, of which 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers. With so many factors, many fractions involving sexagesimal numbers are simplified. For example, one hour can be divided evenly into sections of 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 12 minutes, 10 minutes, 6 minutes, 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute. 60 is the smallest number that is divisible by every number from 1 to 6; that is, it is the lowest common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6."]}
{"question": "The true difference between i5 and i7 processors", "answer": "The primary difference between i5 and i7 processors is the performance, with i7 processors being faster and having more cache (onboard memory) to help them deal with repetitive tasks[2][4]. The processor with the higher model number is considered faster[4], but this is not always the case as the i5-6600K is faster than the i7-6700, though it has less cache[4]. Additionally, the i5 and i7 have different architectures for laptops and desktops, meaning they cannot be interchanged[5], and the i7 processor is generally more expensive than the i5[2][4].", "references": ["The main difference between i5 and i7 is that i7 processors are way faster, which allows users to perform high-end operations hassle-free.", "Cache is another major difference between the i7 vs i5. Core i7 processors have more cache, or onboard memory, to help them deal with repetitive tasks. This helps them save time by storing info in the cache instead of waiting to store and retrieve it from the memory on the motherboard. The Skylake Core i7 processors have 8 MB of cache while the i5s only have 6 MB.", "Both the processors do not house major differences that could create a buzz. The primary difference is the performance and a few features that aid performance. Some people have a misconception that i5 and i7 have a lot of differences, which isn't true.

Within the i5 and the i7 families, there are individual processors with a four digit model number, like the Core i7-6700 and the Core i5-6600K. A higher number means better performance, as the i5-6500 is faster than the i5-6400. Remember how we said the Core i7 is generally faster than the i5? This isn\u2019t always true, as the Intel Core i56600K is faster than the Core i7-6700, however it has less cache.", "As a result, users can expect a massive difference between the prices of both processors.

{"question": "What does fuel stabilizer do to gasoline?", "answer": "Fuel stabilizer works to stop the oxidation and chemical breakdown of gasoline by acting as an antioxidant and absorbing water before the fuel can do the same[3]. It also protects against varnish and gum formation, as well as fuel-system corrosion[4]. To get the best results, it is recommended to pour the fuel stabilizer into the tank and run the engine for a few minutes to distribute it through the system[3], and to opt for an ethanol-free type of gas[2][5].", "references": ["What does a fuel stabilizer do? As you might guess, a fuel stabilizer is something you can add to the fuel that will improve its stability and make the fuel more resistant to the things around it that want to interact with the fuel and cause it to go \u201cbad\u201d.", "By analogy, fuel stabilizer is an antioxidant for your gasoline. It disrupts the free-radical-induced chain reaction that causes gas to oxidize and form varnish and gums. Some stabilizer products, like AMSOIL Quickshot, also contain chemistry that increases solvency and breaks down existing varnish, helping clean a dirty carburetor and restore performance.", "Fuel stabilizer works to stop this oxidation and chemical breakdown from happening. By pouring it into your tank and running the engine for a few minutes to distribute it through the system, it functions partly as an antioxidant and partly by absorbing water before your fuel can do the same. The chemicals in stabilizer do their best to slow down the negative effects of long-term gasoline storage. It\u2019s important to remember that this product can\u2019t work miracles. If you\u2019re storing a vehicle for more than a few years, you may want to investigate how you can keep fresh fuel moving through the lines (typically by regularly running through a tank on a specific schedule). For seasonal storage, however, it\u2019s an excellent tool to have at your disposal.", "So, if it\u2019s formulated properly, like AMSOIL Gasoline Stabilizer, fuel stabilizer improves the stability of gasoline to protect against varnish and gum formation so your vehicles and equipment fire to life when you take them from storage. AMSOIL Gasoline Stabilizer also protects against corrosion during storage to maintain fuel-system cleanliness while stabilizing fuel for up to 12 months.", "This disperses the fuel stabilizer with gasoline and ensures that your tank is minimally exposed to air or water. For best results, opt for an ethanol-free type of gas."]}
{"question": "How do cars calculate speed and preview it on the speedometer?", "answer": "The speedometer of a car measures the instantaneous speed of the vehicle and displays that data to the driver through the dashboard of the vehicle[1][2][3]. It works by gauging how quickly the wheels are spinning and then using electromagnetism to convert the spinning wheel energy into a smooth drifting motion in the gauge[4]. The speedometer is part of the instrument cluster which also displays other important vehicle statistics such as miles traveled, temperature of the vehicle, and fuel levels[5].", "references": ["The speedometer of a car shows its instantaneous speed (as we understand it) and not the average speed. Technically, instantaneous speed is also average speed, but calculated over a very, very small time period. Speed is nothing but a ratio of distance traveled and time taken. Instantaneous speed is calculated by distance traveled in an instant (hence instantaneous), while the average speed is calculated over a more appreciable time period. A quick way to check it is by looking in your car's speedometer very often. You will notice that as we accelerate or decelerate the speedometer's reading changes. Another way to notice this is to drive at a constant speed (maybe using cruise control) for some time and then decelerate (by braking) and check the speedometer. You will notice that from a constant reading, it will start falling down as you apply the brakes, thus giving you a measure of your car's instantaneous speed.", "The speedometer has two separate semicircles which contain a set of numbers. The smaller semi circle shows numbers in kilometers and the exterior semi circle typically displays figures in miles. As the hand of the speedometer sweeps through the circles, where it sits is the current speed of the vehicle.", "The speedometer is the device in a vehicle that captures the speed and displays that data to the driver through the dashboard of the vehicle. There are several types of speedometers that work in various ways. They all measure how quickly the wheels rotate. Another component similar to the speedometer is the odometer.

{"question": "How does the ISS avoid damage from solar wind's if it is always in constant orbit?", "answer": "The International Space Station (ISS) takes advantage of several methods to avoid damage from the solar wind. The ISS is placed in a high-inclination orbit, which means that it spends part of every 90-minute circumnavigation at high latitudes, where Earth's magnetic field is less effective at shielding impinging radiation[2]. Mission schedules are also designed to minimize astronaut exposure to the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) during extravehicular activity (EVAs)[1]. Near-term actions include programmatic and operational ways to take advantage of the multiagency assets that currently monitor and forecast space weather, and ways to improve the in situ measurements and the predictive power of current models[4]. Lastly, the ISS moves along its 16 orbits per day, and its per-orbit risk of exposure to solar energetic particles varies from zero to a maximum that depends on the size of the SPE zones[5].", "references": ["knows how to design mission schedules to minimize astronaut exposure to the SAA during EVAs, and there is little anyone can do to minimize GCR exposure. In 1993, however, the United States agreed with the Russian Federation to incorporate Russian launch capabilities into ISS construction and maintenance. That agreement brought with it the need to place ISS in a high-inclination orbit, essentially the same as that of the Mir space station, 51.6 degrees geographic. Consequently, ISS and the astronauts who construct and use it run the risk of being exposed to solar energetic particles and penetrating electrons in the horns of the outer belt. Exposure from these sources will be sporadic since SPEs follow solar storms and HREs follow magnetic storms and impacts by strong solar wind shocks. During the declining phase of a solar cycle\u2014perhaps late in ISS construction\u2014HRE events are also associated with times, lasting about a week, when solar wind streams are especially fast. Whereas satellite encounters with the SAA are as predictable as the tides, usually solar energetic particles, geomagnetic storms, and high-speed solar wind streams are not reliably predictable, nor is the intensity of the associated radiation event. The high-inclination orbit of ISS therefore introduces a new radiation risk factor.", "A major objective of the International Space Station is learning how to cope with the inherent risks of human spaceflight\u2014how to live and work in space for extended periods. The construction of the station itself provides the first opportunity for doing so. Prominent among the challenges associated with ISS construction is the large amount of time that astronauts will be spending doing extravehicular activity (EVA), or \"space walks.\" EVAs from the space shuttle have been extraordinarily successful, most notably the on-orbit repair of the Hubble Space Telescope. But the number of hours of EVA for ISS construction exceeds that of the Hubble repair mission by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the ISS orbit has nearly twice the inclination to Earth's equator as Hubble's orbit, so it spends part of every 90-minute circumnavigation at high latitudes, where Earth's magnetic field is less effective at shielding impinging radiation. This means that astronauts sweeping through these regions will be considerably more vulnerable to dangerous doses of energetic particles from a sudden solar eruption.", "ISS construction and concurrent station maintenance will entail more than 1,500 hours of EVAs over a 4-year period, 1998 to 2002, that straddles the peak in the current solar cycle. The station's high-inclination orbit (51.6 degrees) cuts through radiation environments more severe than those of the originally planned low-inclination orbit (28 degrees). The high-latitude radiation environments (energetic particles from solar storms and relativistic electrons in Earth's outer radiation belt) are highly variable. At the height of their variability, they are intense enough to pose a hazard to astronauts engaged in EVAs, although even doses estimated for worst-case scenarios fall short of life-threatening. (This is in contrast to the situation astronauts could face in flights beyond the protective shield of Earth's magnetic field\u2014for example, on a flight to Mars.36)", "Radiation and the International Space Station estimates that the likelihood of having a potentially dangerous solar event during an EVA is indeed very high. This report recommends steps that can be taken immediately, and over the next several years, to provide adequate warning so that the astronauts can be directed to take protective cover inside the ISS or shuttle. The near-term actions include programmatic and operational ways to take advantage of the multiagency assets that currently monitor and forecast space weather, and ways to improve the in situ measurements and the predictive power of current models.", "Figure 1.5 reveals three groups of orbits that intersect radiation zones. One group crosses the SAA on the descending leg of the orbits, a second group crosses it on the ascending leg of the orbits, and a third group crosses the SPE zones.

{"question": "The different branches of Christianity, and why they are no longer combated as heresy", "answer": "The different branches of Christianity are no longer combated as heresy due to a variety of factors. One is the concept of adiaphora, or \u201cindifferent things\u201d, which means that theological differences are allowed and people are encouraged to \u201clive and let live\u201d. With the Reformation in the 16th century, most Protestant churches drastically revised the notion of heresy and allowed for people to maintain the doctrines of their own communion while not regarding those who hold different views as heretics[2]. Additionally, the lack of a central doctrinal authority in Protestantism has meant that beliefs can often not be unanimously considered heretical[3]. Furthermore, a person must be baptized to commit heresy, meaning that movements that do not practice baptism (or valid baptism) are not heresies, but separate religions[4]. Lastly, Walter Bauer's Rechtgl\u00e4ubigkeit und Ketzerei im \u00e4ltesten Christentum argued that originally unity was based on a common relationship with the same Lord rather than on formally defined doctrines, and Henry Chadwick's account suggests that all Christian communities were linked by the foundational events which occurred in Jerusalem[5].", "references": ["The danger of heresy does not mean Christians can\u2019t differ on any theological questions whatsoever.

The Roman Catholic Church, satisfied that it is the true church armed with an infallible authority, has alone remained faithful to the ancient and medieval theory of heresy, and it occasionally denounces doctrines or opinions that it considers heretical. Most of the great Protestant churches similarly started with the assumption that their own particular doctrines embodied the final statement of Christian truth and were thus prepared to denounce as heretics those who differed with them, but, with the gradual growth of toleration and the 20th-century ecumenical movement, most Protestant churches drastically revised the notion of heresy as understood in the pre-Reformation church. It does not now seem to them inconsistent for people to stoutly maintain the doctrines of their own communion while not regarding as heretics those who hold different views. The Roman Catholic Church, too, draws a distinction between those who willfully and persistently adhere to doctrinal error and those who embrace it through no fault of their own\u2014e.g., as a result of upbringing in another tradition.", "While individual branches of the Protestant Church have also used the concept in proceedings against individuals and groups deemed to be heretical by those branches, the lack of a central doctrinal authority has meant that beliefs can often not be unanimously considered heretical from the Protestant perspective.

Examples include Muslims, who do not practice baptism, and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, who do not practice valid baptism.", "Traditionally, orthodoxy and heresy have been viewed in relation to the \"orthodoxy\" as an authentic lineage of tradition. Other forms of Christianity were viewed as deviant streams of thought and therefore \"heterodox\", or heretical. This view was dominant until the publication of Walter Bauer's Rechtgl\u00e4ubigkeit und Ketzerei im \u00e4ltesten Christentum (\"Orthodoxy and heresy in ancient Christianity\") in 1934. Bauer endeavored to rethink early Christianity historically, independent from the views of the church. He argued that originally unity was based on a common relationship with the same Lord rather than on formally defined doctrines and that a wide variety of views was tolerated. With time, some of these views were seen as inadequate. He went on to attribute the definition of \"orthodoxy\" to the increasing power and influence of the Church of Rome. In 1959, Henry Chadwick argued that all Christian communities were linked by the foundational events which occurred in Jerusalem and continued to be of defining importance in the forging of doctrinal orthodoxy.

{"question": "Considering the origins of the English language (of which I have limited knowledge).

However, it is unlikely that humans would be able to learn an alien language that violates universal grammar[1][4], and the internal structure of an alien language is a difficult question[1][3][4]. Additionally, any alien language is likely to be communicated in a different frequency range than humans can perceive[4], which could make it difficult for humans to understand. However, it is plausible that any technologically versatile alien civilisation would have something like language, as language is the single most important factor in human cooperation[5].", "references": ["So, it might be reasonable to assume that humans could learn alien languages.

This concept is sometimes conjectured to be applicable to real-world causes of death as well.", "Hugh Everett did not mention quantum suicide or quantum immortality in writing; his work was intended as a solution to the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Eugene Shikhovtsev's biography of Everett states that \"Everett firmly believed that his many-worlds theory guaranteed him immortality: his consciousness, he argued, is bound at each branching to follow whatever path does not lead to death\". Peter Byrne, author of a biography of Everett, reports that Everett also privately discussed quantum suicide (such as to play high-stakes Russian roulette and survive in the winning branch), but adds that \"[i]t is unlikely, however, that Everett subscribed to this [quantum immortality] view, as the only sure thing it guarantees is that the majority of your copies will die, hardly a rational goal.\"", "As a thought experiment, quantum suicide is an intellectual exercise in which an abstract setup is followed through to its logical consequences merely to prove a theoretical point. Virtually all physicists and philosophers of science who have described it, especially in popularized treatments, underscore that it relies on contrived, idealized circumstances that may be impossible or exceedingly difficult to realize in real life, and that its theoretical premises are controversial even among supporters of the many-worlds interpretation. Thus, as cosmologist Anthony Aguirre warns, \"[...] it would be foolish (and selfish) in the extreme to let this possibility guide one's actions in any life-and-death question.\"", "Cosmologist Anthony Aguirre, while personally skeptical of most accounts of the many-worlds interpretation, in his book Cosmological Koans writes that \"[p]erhaps reality actually is this bizarre, and we really do subjectively 'survive' any form of death that is both instantaneous and binary.\" Aguirre notes, however, that most causes of death do not fulfill these two requirements: \"If there are degrees of survival, things are quite different.\" If loss of consciousness was binary like in the thought experiment, the quantum suicide effect would prevent an observer from subjectively falling asleep or undergoing anesthesia, conditions in which mental activities are greatly diminished but not altogether abolished. Consequently, upon most causes of death, even outwardly sudden, if the quantum suicide effect holds true an observer is more likely to progressively slip into an attenuated state of consciousness, rather than remain fully awake by some very improbable means. Aguirre further states that quantum suicide as a whole might be characterized as a sort of reductio ad absurdum against the current understanding of both the many-worlds interpretation and theory of mind. He finally hypothesizes that a different understanding of the relationship between the mind and time should remove the bizarre implications of necessary subjective survival.", "One of the weirder implications of MWI that I've read here is that quantum immortality implies that it's literally impossible for me to die.

{"question": "how do sinkholes happen", "answer": "Sinkholes typically happen when the rock below the land surface is limestone, carbonate rock, salt beds, or rocks that can naturally be dissolved by groundwater circulating through them[3]. As the rock dissolves, spaces and caverns develop underground and if there is not enough support for the land above the spaces, then a sudden collapse of the land surface can occur[3].

Depending on how they are conducted, lobbying activities can greatly advance or block progress on these global challenges.", "Lobbyists can facilitate access for stakeholders to complex government decision-making processes. Their objective is to make sure that the perspectives of companies and other organisations are heard and can influence decisions in parliaments, regulatory agencies and government entities.

{"question": "How and Why exactly does encryption work? Dont you need to transfer the key, and couldnt (lets say the NSA) not simply obtain it by saving all your internet activity?", "answer": "Encryption works by using an encryption key to scramble the data, which makes it unreadable to anyone who does not have the key. The encryption key is a piece of information that controls the cryptographic process and permits a plain-text string to be encrypted and decrypted[2]. In order to protect against the possibility of the NSA obtaining the key, it is possible to use a technique called OTP (one time pad) in combination with other encryption methods, so that even if one of the encryption methods is broken, the data is still secure[3]. Additionally, encryption keys may have an active life shorter than an authorized user's access to the data, so the old key can be archived and used only for decryption, and the new key will be used to encrypt and decrypt data[4]. Finally, full disk encryption is a good starting point for ordinary people to start using encryption because it provides strong encryption, is built into all major operating systems, and takes minimal effort to use[5].", "references": ["\"3) Assume that while your computer can be compromised, it would take work and risk on the part of the NSA \u2013 so it probably isn\u2019t.

Using OTP with other encryption methods probably won\u2019t make the security any worse, especially when there is reason to suspect that some of those other encryption methods might be broken. Wouldn\u2019t it be preferable that there would be still some security left even if some encryption method is later found to be weak?", "Given this, your encryption key may have an active life shorter than an authorized user's access to the data. This means that you will need to archive de-activated keys and use them only for decryption. Once the data has been decrypted by the old key, it will be encrypted by the new key, and over time the old key will no longer be used to encrypt/decrypt data and can be deleted. (see graphic below)", "But how can ordinary people get started using encryption?

{"question": "Why is insurance handled by private, for-profit companies rather than by the government?", "answer": "There are several reasons why insurance is handled by private, for-profit companies rather than by the government. One is that private health insurance schemes are defined as those that are wholly or partially financed and managed by an entity (organisation/institution/company) that is not state-owned, irrespective of whether it is a for-profit or a not-for-profit entity [1]. Another reason is that the potential for profits motivates insurers to seek greater efficiency in the way they pay for health care, and if more individuals bought their own insurance, rather than having their employers do it for them, the prospect of profit would motivate more insurers, doctors, and hospitals to offer what consumers want: more options and lower prices [2]. Additionally, private for-profit insurance companies are incentivized to pursue economic efficiencies and constantly seek ways to boost corporate earnings[3] and provide different types of policies for different amounts of money and different levels of protection[4]. Finally, government insurance programs may be based on weak rationales and may not be justified[5].", "references": ["The basic function of health insurance is to provide access to care with financial risk protection (Kutzin 2001). Private health insurance (PHI) is defined as insurance taken up voluntarily and paid for privately, either by individuals or by employers on behalf of individuals (Mossialos 2002). It may be sold by a wide range of entities, both public and private in nature, which may include statutory \u2018sickness funds,\u2018 non-profit mutual or provident associations and commercial for-profit insurance companies (Thomson 2009).

In a speech to a joint session of Congress last September, President Obama argued that \"by avoiding some of the overhead that gets eaten up at private companies by profits, [government health insurance] could provide a good deal for consumers.\" But profits do not \"eat up\" overhead. Indeed, the opposite is true: Overhead eats up profits. This is why insurance companies are incentivized to reduce administrative costs, along with any other unnecessary expenses. The potential for profits motivates insurers to seek greater efficiency in the way they pay for health care. And if more individuals bought their own insurance \u2014 rather than having their employers do it for them \u2014 the prospect of profit would motivate more insurers, doctors, and hospitals to offer what consumers want: more options and lower prices.", "Those who are intuitively suspicious of the profit motive in medicine will naturally also be suspicious of private health insurance. After all, a for-profit insurance company's first obligation is to generate revenues in excess of expenses, not to provide unlimited care for everyone. This means pursuing economic efficiencies \u2014 up to and including denying sick people money for their care \u2014 and constantly seeking ways to boost corporate earnings. To those who advocate care for the sick regardless of economic circumstances, the business model of insurance will always grate.", "But the new demand for health insurance presented a business opportunity and spawned an emerging market with other motivations. Suddenly, at a time when medicine had more of value to offer, tens of millions of people were interested in gaining access and expected their employers to provide insurance so they could do so. For-profit insurance companies moved in, unencumbered by the Blues\u2019 charitable mission. They accepted only younger, healthier patients on whom they could make a profit. They charged different rates, depending on factors like age, as they had long done with life insurance.

{"question": "How does a contagion spread from contact with an open wound to the target organ in the body ?", "answer": "Contagions can spread from contact with an open wound to the target organ in the body through hematogenous spread. In this process, the virus spreads to other organs through the bloodstream by entering the interstitial fluid that bathes all our cells within the tissues. Virions then enter the lymphatic vessels, which lead back to lymph nodes, and then continue within the lymph and eventually returned to the bloodstream[1]. Contagions can also spread through contact with contaminated objects or surfaces[2][3], through sexual contact[2], from a mother to her unborn child through body fluids[2], and through airborne droplets from an infected person when they talk, cough or sneeze.", "references": ["Virions spread to other organs through one of two ways. In hematogenous spread, viruses spread to target organs using the bloodstream. This can occur through direct injection into the blood, as would happen with animal or insect bites, or it can occur from virions entering the interstitial fluid that bathes all our cells within the tissues. This interstitial fluid, or lymph, is collected in lymphatic vessels that lead back to lymph nodes (Fig. 5.8 ). Immune system cells filter the lymph within the lymph nodes, but high virion concentrations can mean that some escape these cells and continue within the lymph, which is eventually returned to the bloodstream. Viremia is the term used to describe the presence of virus within the bloodstream. Since blood circulates throughout the entire body, viruses can use the bloodstream to gain access to their cellular targets in organs other than the ones through which they entered the body. Primary viremia indicates the first time that the virus is found in the bloodstream. After replicating within the target organ, additional virions may enter the bloodstream. This is known as a secondary viremia.", "There are other ways of describing how germs are spread that are commonly used. Germs can be spread through sexual contact, which is usually through semen and vaginal secretions (body fluids), but can also occur through contact with mucus membranes. Germs can spread through food or water. Many but not all the germs spread in this way are through contact with faeces and then with the mouth (faeco-oral). Germs can also spread from a mother to her unborn child, usually though blood (body fluids) but also through contact with skin or mucous membranes during delivery.", "Some infections are spread directly when skin or mucous membrane (the thin moist lining of many parts of the body such as the nose, mouth, throat and genitals) comes into contact with the skin or mucous membrane of another person.

{"question": "How does a state minimum wage increase impact people?", "answer": "Increasing the minimum wage can have both positive and negative impacts on people. It can raise the earnings and family income of low-wage workers, potentially lifting some families out of poverty[2][3]. However, it can also cause other low-wage workers to become jobless, and their family income would fall[3]. The effects of a minimum wage increase vary depending on the magnitude of the increase and the local economy and cost of living in the region[4].

By boosting the income of low-wage workers with jobs, a higher minimum wage would lift some families\u2019 income above the poverty threshold and thereby reduce the number of people in poverty. But low-wage workers who lost employment would see their earnings decrease, and in some cases their family income would fall below the poverty threshold.

{"question": "Why things glow white when they got real hot", "answer": "Hot objects glow because they are emitting light due to their high temperature. As an object heats up, it first turns red, then orange (red+yellow light), and finally white (red+yellow+blue looks white to the eye)[1]. This is due to the quantum mechanical processes that allow atoms to emit light[2]. The temperature at which an object starts to glow visibly is around 3000 to 3400 K (Kelvin), which is roughly 2700 to 3100 degrees Celsius. This is why stars and other objects can be approximated as black bodies and is a good model for understanding why hot things glow[4]. This is also why we naturally associate color with descriptions of hot things, as hot objects tend to glow red or white[5].", "references": ["Red things are hot, but white things are hotter! Here's why. When a hot object starts emitting light, it starts by giving off the lowest energy light, which is red light. As it gets hotter, it then gets enough energy to emit yellow and eventually blue light, while at the same time still emitting the red light. The reason is that yellow and blue light takes more energy to emit than does red light, so a higher temperature is needed. So, as an object heats up, it first turns red, then orange (red+yellow light), and finally white (red+yellow+blue looks white to the eye).", "In this article, we\u2019ll learn and understand the physical reasons for why hot things tend to glow.

{"question": "What is an orchestral conductor doing, and how can everyone follow what he's doing regardless of what instrument they have?", "answer": "An orchestra conductor's primary job is to prepare the musical ensemble for public presentations by interpreting musical works and communicating those interpretations to the musicians via arm gestures[5]. Additionally, the conductor is also responsible for making creative and business decisions such as choosing repertoire, promoting orchestra events, recruiting new musicians, and resolving conflicts[3]. Lastly, the conductor serves as a messenger for the composer, conveying the music through gesture so the orchestra understands it perfectly[4]. In order for everyone to follow the conductor's cues, he or she must learn an entire score rather than its individual parts, and must expand their own expertise through advanced degrees and other events[1][5].", "references": ["All musicians in an orchestra must be proficient with their individual parts, but a conductor of an orchestra has to learn entire scores because he or she functions as a musical traffic director, cuing musicians so they enter or leave the musical highway at the right time. To become familiar with a given score, a conductor generally studies it visually, paying attention to theoretical considerations, such as instrumental transposition and harmonic progression. He or she usually makes personal notes in the score as study and rehearsal progress.

{"question": "Why can't governments print \"temporary\" money to cover important expenses?", "answer": "Governments cannot print \"temporary\" money to cover important expenses because doing so would lead to inflation and, in extreme cases, hyper-inflation[3]. This is because printing money in a situation where demand is running ahead of supply will cause the value of the money to decrease relative to the goods that can be purchased with it, resulting in a hidden tax for citizens due to higher costs of goods[3][5].", "references": ["Such projections have led many to ask whether there are alternative ways to finance this support that might avoid a long period of fiscal adjustment after the worst of the crisis is over. For example, why can\u2019t we just print the money?

The mistake stems from the view that there is only one way the government should plan to run a deficit, namely by borrowing.

But there is an alternative, what is popularly known as \u2018printing money\u2019, though these days there would be no actual printing \u2013 just money in digital accounts. Compared to issuing debt, money financing has the attraction that there is no interest to be paid now or by future generations. But there is a catch, one that has led money financing to be regarded as taboo. If a government pays for a deficit by printing money in a situation where demand is running ahead of supply, it leads to inflation, and, in extreme cases, hyper-inflation. The Weimar Republic and more recently Zimbabwe are classic cases.", "With the government borrowing heavily to fund its pandemic response and recovery, it has been suggested it could simply cancel its debt by printing more money. That sounds like an attractive idea, but it is one that would have seriously adverse consequences.", "Griffith: Well, governments often get away with inflation. Remember the governments have a vested interest in being able to have their central banks print these resources because as the value of that dollar declines relative to the goods that can purchase it, that also means the relative value of the government debt has gone down. It makes it easier for the government to service that debt. But we all pay that with the higher cost of our goods. We just don't notice it and that part is really a hidden tax because most people don't connect the dots. They just think it is a law of nature that prices are going to increase one or 2% a year."]}

This was a common occurrence during the Middle Ages, as warfare was constant and power lay with substantial property owners. It was almost impossible for any medieval ruler of substance to avoid fighting for his entire career[1]. Warfare was dictated by the length that an archer could shoot an arrow, and by the strength of the arms that wielded swords and spears[2].

This consumption included not only the expenses of waging war but, almost invariably, the deliberate destruction of economic assets that accompanied invasions, and sometimes retreats as well. Power lay with substantial property owners. In the absence of powerful centralized governments local rulers could and did make war for almost every reason imaginable.

The most essential fact to bear in mind is that the key to Western European society in the Central Middle Ages was land, or, more specifically, the ownership of land. As a result, the interests of landowners often shaped warfare; military activity was invariably conducted by the ruling elite in order to protect their own land, or with the aim to capture new territory from a rival. While there was a degree of development in the technology of weapons and armour over the period, there was no great transformative revolution; throughout these centuries, warfare remained largely dictated by the length that an archer could shoot an arrow, and by the strength of the arms that wielded swords and spears.", "Take World War I, for instance.

{"question": "Would increasing the minimum wage and setting a maximum wage strengthen the middle class?", "answer": "Increasing the minimum wage and setting a maximum wage could potentially help strengthen the middle class by creating a new floor and wage increases that will ripple through the wage distribution[1]. It would also reduce income inequality and serve as a foundation for job creation[1], while bringing relief to workers struggling to make ends meet[3]. Additionally, it would raise the incomes of people who make slightly more than minimum wage[3], as well as benefit the economy by increasing consumer activity, spurring job growth, and lowering the federal deficit[4].

In the creation of the outfits, much time is given to detail and qualities, thus the skill of a cosplayer may be measured by how difficult the details of the outfit are and how well they have been replicated. Because of the difficulty of replicating some details and materials, cosplayers often educate themselves in crafting specialties such as textiles, sculpture, face paint, fiberglass, fashion design, woodworking, and other uses of materials in the effort to render the look and texture of a costume accurately. Cosplayers often wear wigs in conjunction with their outfit to further improve the resemblance to the character.

{"question": "Why do lights and stars sometimes appear to have points sticking out of them?", "answer": "Stars appear to have points sticking out of them because of the diffraction of the light that enters through a small circular aperture, like the eye[1][3][5]. This diffraction creates a pattern consisting of a bright spot (Airy disk) surrounded by several concentric circles (Airy pattern)[3]. The 5 pointed star might have originated from the way the Egyptians represented the star in hyroglypics, or from the diffraction spikes that some very bright stars have[5].

The twinkling from adjacent areas of the disc averages out, and as a result, we see tiny variation in the total light coming from the planet.

The 5 pointed star might have originated from the way the Egyptians represented the star in hyroglypics. If you look at a really bright star sometime you might notice that it does appear to have lines coming out from it. These are called diffraction spikes and appear because of the way the light enters your eye which is a small circular hole.

{"question": "when is space where there is nothing but emptiness, what do rocket engines thrust against that make them move forward?", "answer": "In space, rockets use a process called Newton's Third Law of Motion to thrust forward. This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the case of a rocket, the action is the expelling of gas out of the engine, and the reaction is the movement of the rocket in the opposite direction[5].

{"question": "Why does smoking preserve food?", "answer": "Smoking food is an effective form of food preservation because it relies on low heat[1][2], which kills microbes[3]. The combination of smoke and salt also helps preserve meat by acting as preservatives[3]. The smoke helps to dry the meat, which is accelerated by the addition of salt[3][5]. Additionally, in the past, smoking was used in combination with other techniques such as salt-curing or drying to further preserve food[5].", "references": ["Smoking, as a mode of food preservation, is probably as old as cooking with fire. Heat and smoke infuse a delicate flavor into fish, ham, poultry and meat and can prevent the growth of microbes. While smoking done right is a very effective form of food preservation, care must be taken to avoid contamination and food-borne illness.", "Smoking food is different from the other food preservation methods because it relies on low heat. Some other methods rely on dry heat, commonly known as frying or grilling. Smoking food for preservation differs from smoking food for immediate eating in that food meant for preservation is placed far away from the heat source, and the food is never dipped in any liquid.", "According to Livestrong, the process of smoking involves using a combination of smoke and salt to preserve meat. There are a few different reasons why smoking helps preserve meat. The heat kills microbes and chemicals found in smoke act as preservatives. According to Science Direct, these chemicals collect on the surface of the meat and help prevent the development of microorganisms. The smoke also helps dry the meat, a process that is accelerated by the addition of salt.", "Food smoking is a technique that began thousands of years ago. It is believed that food preservation dates back to when humans invented fire. It is a practice passed down through generations and is still being used in some parts of the world. The older generation primarily smoked food to preserve it, but today it\u2019s a bit different. Food is now being smoked to cook, flavor, or preserve it using smoke from burning wood chips, charcoal briquettes, and wood dust.", "In the past, smoking was a useful preservation tool, in combination with other techniques, most commonly salt-curing or drying. In some cases, particularly in climates without much hot sunshine, smoking was simply an unavoidable side effect of drying over a fire. For some long-smoked foods, the smoking time also served to dry the food. Drying, curing, or other techniques can render the interior of foods inhospitable to bacterial life, while the smoking gives the vulnerable exterior surfaces an extra layer of protection. For oily fish smoking is especially useful, as its antioxidant properties delay surface fat rancidification. (Interior fat is not as exposed to oxygen, which is what causes rancidity.) Some heavily-salted, long-smoked fish can keep without refrigeration for weeks or months. Such heavily-preserved foods usually require a treatment such as boiling in fresh water to make them palatable before eating."]}
{"question": "Why when you stare at a moving pattern for an extended period of time and then look up, why everything's wavy.", "answer": "When you stare at a moving pattern for an extended period of time and then look away, the neurons that were firing in response to the moving pattern continue to fire, even though the moving pattern is no longer in focus[2]. Your brain is still predicting movement, and adjusts the image accordingly, which causes the objects to appear to wave as it tries to predict the movement[3]. This phenomenon is known as a peripheral drift illusion, and is caused by straining the eyes to focus on harsh patterns[5].", "references": ["ELI5:Why when you stare at a moving pattern for an extended period of time and then look up, why everything's wavy.", "This is due to how the movement is processed in the brain. Very basically, there are certain neurons that are firing in response to the moving pattern. The moving pattern is constant, so they are firing continuously. When you look away those same cells continue to fire because they've been doing so for however long you were looking at it. Your brain knows that the moving pattern is no longer in focus, but it still takes a bit to inhibit the neurons and stop them from firing. It's why optical illusions like this one work.", "When you're staring at the moving bottle caps for a long time, your brain gets used to the movement and predicts that the movement will continue. This is great, because it lets you track the moving objects better, since you're anticipating it instead of trying to catch up. When you look away, though, your brain is still predicting movement, and adjusts the image accordingly. Since those things are not moving, they appear to wave as your brain predicts their movement, then corrects for the fact that they didn't move, then predicts they'll move again, then corrects again, and so on until it catches on to the fact that things aren't moving through your field of vision anymore.", "Both are examples of a peripheral drift illusion, in which we perceive still images as moving ones. Interestingly enough, when you stare at one part of the photo without moving or blinking your eyes, that part stops \"swirling\" (while the circles in your peripheral vision continue to \"move\").", "Have you ever looked at a still stripy pattern and felt that it was moving in front of your very eyes?

{"question": "Why are Saturday morning cartoons idealized? What\u2019s so different about them as opposed to other days\u2019 cartoons?", "answer": "Saturday morning cartoons are idealized because they were a shared experience for many people growing up, as they were one of the few shared experiences[1]. They were also heavily promoted[4] and were a phenomenon that was unique to its time[1][3][5]. Saturday morning cartoons also had a specific target audience, as kids were more likely to stay indoors to watch them, as opposed to engaging in outdoor activities or playing video games[2]. They were also often created to meet regulations on children's television programming in the United States[5].", "references": ["Growing up, 8 a.m. to noon on Saturdays was a sacred time.

You couldn\u2019t text, tweet, or engage online, but TV \u2014 and cartoons \u2014 was something you all got to experience at the same moment.", "The end of the classic era of Saturday morning cartoons can also be traced to the changing lifestyles and interests of their target audiences. By the 2000s, video games and computers had largely replaced broadcast television as a Saturday morning diversion. Would-be cartoon watchers were also becoming more involved in sports and other outdoor activities, not staying indoors to watch generic cartoons available at other times on other cartoon-oriented cable networks. Combined with parental concerns over the heavy commercial promotion of unhealthy snack foods or movie tie-in products, this loss of the primary target audience has encouraged the four major broadcast networks to rethink their Saturday morning programming.", "The final question remains: will cartoons ever return to Saturday mornings to the same degree that they existed during the 70s and 80s? The answer is no. The reason for this is the same reason why people no longer watch silent movies or black and white TVs or primetime sitcoms where married couples sleep in separate beds: once things evolve, they seldom return to their simpler forms. Saturday morning cartoons were a phenomenon that now resides in the history books. It is an anomaly in the history of childrens broadcasting, the likes of which will never be seen again. For anyone who remembers the paramount of Saturday morning cartoons, they can keep those memories of childhood dear in their hearts along with other great relics from the 80s including parachute pants, Pogo balls and saying Have a nice day! because Saturday morning cartoons are gone for good on broadcast networks.", "At one point in time, Saturday morning cartoons were promoted just as heavily as any prime time programming.", "\"Saturday-morning cartoon\" is a colloquial term for the original animated series programming that was typically scheduled on Saturday and Sunday mornings in the United States on the \"Big Three\" television networks. The genre's popularity had a broad peak from the mid-1960s through the mid-1990s; after that point it declined, in the face of changing cultural norms, increased competition from formats available at all times, and heavier regulations. In the last two decades of the genre's existence, Saturday-morning and Sunday-morning cartoons were primarily created and aired to meet regulations on children's television programming in the United States, or E/I. Minor television networks, in addition to the non-commercial PBS in some markets, continue to air animated programming on Saturday and Sunday while partially meeting those mandates."]}

{"question": "Why does water cause a near perfect hexagon bokeh on camera lenses?", "answer": "When water is photographed with a camera lens, it can cause a near perfect hexagon bokeh due to the blades of the camera diaphragm creating a polygonal-shaped aperture[1]. The type of lens you are using can influence the shape of the bokeh. Older lenses tend to produce straight edges and hexagonal shapes, while newer, more up-to-date lenses will produce a round, circular blur[2]. The bokeh is also affected by the lens\u2019 diaphragm blades, which is determined by the aperture[3]. Polygonal bokeh shapes, such as hexagons, can be harsh and distracting[4], so it is best to invest in a good lens to get the perfect bokeh effect[2]. If your lens has a tendency to produce strong hexagons, aside from avoiding point light source and reflections, you may need to replace the lens[5].", "references": ["It\u2019s a manifestation of an optical phenomenon called 'bokeh', which is Japanese for the effect of camera equipment on out-of-focus images. In the case of raindrops, it\u2019s a result of the blades of the camera diaphragm creating a polygonal-shaped aperture. The exact shape varies on the vintage and type of the camera.", "There are many aspects that influence the result of Bokeh in your image. Let\u2019s start with the camera lens, as this is arguably the most important part. The camera lens is what produces the blur effect from the lighting. To get the perfect Bokeh effect, you want a round, circular blur from the highlights in the background. Remember to be careful though, because the bigger the circles get, the higher the chance of them bleeding into the background. If you look carefully at different Bokeh backgrounds, you will see that the circles are shapes and sizes. This can be influenced by the type of lens you are using. Older lenses tend to produce straight edges and hexagonal shapes, but newer, more up-to-date lenses will produce that sweet circular shape. For this reason, it\u2019s worth investing in a good lens.", "The bokeh is affected by the lens\u2019 diaphragm blades (this is determined by aperture). Circular diaphragm blades create round highlights; more angular, hexagonal-type blades will create distorted, angular shapes in the highlights. There is a consensus that the former is \u2018good bokeh\u2019 and the latter is \u2018bad bokeh\u2019, but of course, photography is subjective.", "If you study the out-of-focus highlights of some lenses, you can see the actual polygon shape from the aperture diaphragm revealing itself in the bokeh. Although bokeh quality is subjective, the most common opinion seems to be that polygonal bokeh shapes can be harsh and distracting. I am in the minority here because I sometimes enjoy the polygonal shapes in some bokeh.", "My 85/1.8 (AI'd) has very strong tendency to produce strong hexagons. Aside from avoiding point light source and reflections, what else can we do to it (short of replacing the lens)? It is quite sad to see a terrific lens having such a fatal flaw."]}
{"question": "- if pi is in between the number 3 and 4 how can it be infinite?", "answer": "Pi is infinite because the number of decimal places can be extended to an infinite amount of decimal places. This is because pi can be calculated by considering polygons with an increasing number of sides, allowing us to generate as many digits of pi as we like. Additionally, infinity is not always undefined arithmetically and can have many values when considering sets[3]. This was first explored by the Greek geometer Archimedes, who was one of the first to use infinity as a mathematical workhorse[4]. Finally, pi has no exact numerical representation in a finite number of digits in any number/radix system, making it infinite[5].", "references": ["By allowing the number of sides in the polygons to increase indefinitely, all the way out to infinity, we can generate as many digits of pi as we like, at least in principle.", "The unknown value of pi is being trapped in a numerical vise, squeezed between two numbers that look almost identical, except the first has a denominator of 71 and the last has a denominator of 70. By considering polygons with even more sides, later mathematicians tightened the vise even further. Around 1,600 years ago, the Chinese geometer Zu Chongzhi pondered polygons having an incredible 24,576 sides to squeeze pi out to eight digits:", "And it is not so far removed from school maths. We teach that infinity - infinity is undefined arithmetically, but in terms of sets we often show that it can have many values (easiest example is remove all even numbers from 1,2,3,4,5... and you are left with an infinite set, compared to match up 1<->2, 2<->4, 3<->6 etc and show that none are left behind). Exposure to such conflicts is a great and fun way to learn about the limits and context of maths. And a major source of error is not learning the limits, applying things unthinkingly out of context, because too much exposure is only to \"nice\" examples. There is loads of education research on this. These paradoxical results force students to confront the limits, and thus can be used to enhance their mathematical thinking.", "As a ratio, pi has been around since Babylonian times, but it was the Greek geometer Archimedes, some 2,300 years ago, who first showed how to rigorously estimate the value of pi. Among mathematicians of his time, the concept of infinity was taboo; Aristotle had tried to banish it for being too paradoxical and logically treacherous. In Archimedes\u2019s hands, however, infinity became a mathematical workhorse.", "The universal real constant pi, the ratio of the circumference of any circle and its diameter, has no exact numerical representation in a finite number of digits in any number/radix system. It has conjured up tremendous interest in mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike, who spent countless hours over millennia to explore its beauty and varied applications in science and engineering. The article attempts to record the pi exploration over centuries including its successive computation to ever increasing number of digits and its remarkable usages, the list of which is not yet closed."]}

{"question": "Why is there so much apparent public criticism against labor unions when they empower mostly low to middle income workers; who make up the massive majority of workers?", "answer": "The public criticism of labor unions may be due to a lack of understanding about the positive effects of unions. Unions provide a voice for workers, advocating for higher wages and better benefits for their members and by mobilizing and building grassroots coalitions, they act as a countervailing force against corporate concentration[1]. They also help workers win benefits such as health insurance from their employers[2]. Despite the positive effects of labor unions, only one in six Americans live in a household with a union member and a majority of non-union workers say they are not interested in joining a union[3]. This may be due to the fact that corporations viewed unions as a threat to their profits since unionized workers use fewer public benefits and could use slowdowns, work stoppages, and strikes to win wage increases, cost-of-living clauses, and better benefits[4]. Research has also found that where workers have union power, states have more equitable economic structures, social structures, and democracies[5].", "references": ["The data we analyze across a wide range of indicators support the notion that through advocating for higher wages and better benefits for members and, more generally, by mobilizing and building grassroots coalitions and acting as one of the main countervailing forces against rising corporate concentration, unions act as a channel for producing and cementing positive economic, health, and democratic outcomes in the communities in which they are active.", "Sojourner and Pacas (2018) also find that unionized workers use fewer public benefits. Higher incomes allow workers and their families to be less dependent on government benefits, and unions also help workers win benefits such as health insurance from their employers.", "Public approval of labor unions among the U.S. public is at its highest level since 1965, according to a new Gallup poll released on Tuesday. But only one in six Americans live in a household with a union member, and a majority of nonunion workers in the U.S. (58%) say they are \"not interested at all\" in joining a union.", "Although union membership in the private sector declined during the 1960s, that fact was cold comfort for the corporate community. It was far more concerned that the most powerful of the private-sector unions, such as those in construction, steel, and autos, could still use slowdowns, work stoppages, and strikes to win wage increases, cost-of-living clauses, and better benefits in a context of tight labor markets and domestic turmoil, which would raise costs for the largest corporations. As a consequence, reducing union power became the primary concern for both moderates and ultraconservatives in the corporate community by 1968, whether the immediate issue was inflation, wage rates, profit margins, or foreign trade.", "In this report, we document the correlation between higher levels of unionization in states and a range of economic, personal, and democratic well-being measures. In the same way unions give workers a voice at work, with a direct impact on wages and working conditions, the data suggest that unions also give workers a voice in shaping their communities. Where workers have this power, states have more equitable economic structures, social structures, and democracies."]}
{"question": "Why is there so much focus on colonizing Mars and not an equal focus on colonizing the Moon?", "answer": "One reason why there is more focus on colonizing Mars than the Moon is because Mars has an atmosphere that is more robust than the Moon's, and may contain a greater abundance of valuable resources such as water[3].

{"question": "What makes humans want to kiss one another?", "answer": "Kissing is driven by biological and evolutionary factors. Our lips and tongues are packed with nerve endings, which help intensify all those dizzying sensations of being in love when we press our mouths to someone else's[1]. Humans are biologically driven to press their faces together and rub noses or touch lips or tongues[2]. Kissing triggers the release of hormones, such as oxytocin, which helps to trigger the sex drive[3], and helps to boost levels of oxytocin, which also influences social recognition, male and female orgasm, and childbirth, as well as reduce cortisol, the body's main stress hormone[3][4]. It is believed that kissing may have developed as a way to assess genetic compatibility, as well as helping to build emotional bonds between partners.", "references": ["Still, most people are satisfied with the explanation that humans kiss because it feels good. Our lips and tongues are packed with nerve endings, which help intensify all those dizzying sensations of being in love when we press our mouths to someone else's. Experiencing such feelings doesn't usually make us think too hard about why we kiss \u2014 instead, it drives us to find ways to do it more often.", "That last part doesn\u2019t sound too romantic, but romance has very little to do with why we, as a species, are drawn to this very intimate contact. Humans are biologically driven to push their faces together and rub noses or touch lips or tongues.", "According to Fisher, humans have evolved three distinctively different brain systems for mating and reproduction: sex drive, feelings of intense romantic love, and feelings of deep attachment. Saliva contains a lot of testosterone, which helps to trigger the sex drive. And since the internal cheek cells are well built to absorb testosterone, wet kisses cause arousal. As explained earlier, romantic love is triggered by dopamine. And then the third brain system, attachment, is impacted by oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the \"cuddle hormone.\" Oxytocin brings about feelings of emotional closeness and \"cosmic union,\" explains Fisher. She also says that in long-term couples, a kiss not only increases levels of oxytocin but reduces cortisol, the body's main stress hormone. That makes kissing a powerful tool for mating.", "Kissing unleashes a cocktail of chemicals that govern human stress, motivation, social bonding and sexual stimulation. In one study, psychologist Wendy L. Hill and her student Carey A. Wilson, both then at Lafayette College, compared the levels of two key hormones in 15 college male-female couples before and after they kissed and before and after they talked to each other while holding hands. One hormone, oxytocin, is involved in social bonding, and the other, cortisol, plays a role in stress. Hill and Wilson predicted that kissing would boost levels of oxytocin, which also influences social recognition, male and female orgasm, and childbirth. They expected this effect to be particularly pronounced in the study's females, who reported higher levels of intimacy in their relationships. They also forecast a dip in cortisol because kissing is presumably a stress reliever.", "Kissing by pressing our lips together is an almost uniquely human behaviour. If kissing has an evolutionary purpose, why don't we see more animals kissing?"]}

{"question": "Why do the front wheels of big trucks have such big convex hubcaps and lugnuts?", "answer": "Big trucks have large, convex hubcaps and lugnuts on the front wheels because the wheel needs to bulge outwards to accommodate the steering and brakes components[2][5]. This design also helps to achieve a balanced weight distribution for reliable stability while driving[3]. The truck rear wheels are concave to make room for the pair of wheels to be supported on the same hub[4][5]. This design helps to cut the overall cost of building and maintaining the trucks and their trailers[5].", "references": ["The large negative offset of the front wheels means that when you look at a wheel, it appears very convex, whereas we are tuned in to normal offsets, which are concave (a more natural/typcial wheel). Because the front wheel you are looking at is convex, the bolts/lugs are sticking out proud (and big\u2026'cause it is a truck wheel after all).", "In order for the steering components and brakes to be distantly placed, the wheel needs to bulge out outwards. This, in turn, explains the reason behind truck front wheels being convex.", "This is the simple and clear reasons behind the concave truck rear wheel while the truck front wheels are convex. Lastly, remember everything is there for a purpose. Whether the wheels are concave or convex; the distribution is balanced for a safe ride down the roads. Reliable stability while driving along with effective weight distribution are two benefits of the respective shapes of the front and the rear wheels.", "Further, the pair of wheels needs to be supported on the same hub. To do so, the rims are made to overlap one another in order to accommodate the wheels on the same hub. Now this explains the reason behind truck rear wheels being concave.", "Yes, it certainly is that simple. The packaging makes sense with the front wheels convex to make room for necessary components in a space where there is only one wheel at each end of the front axle.

Another factor is that if a raindrop is bigger, it will fall faster, which means it will be flattened more by the surrounding air[3]. On the other side of the size spectrum, we have drizzle rain, which stay small because their distance to each other doesn't grow much and the wind keeps them more or less the same[4]. According to research, the shape of the raindrop also changes due to topological changes as they fall, which can eventually cause them to explode into a chaotic shower of smaller drops of various sizes[5].

{"question": "How did the commonality of \"seeing the light\" originate when people are \"crossing over\" or passing away?", "answer": "The idea of \"seeing the light\" when passing away originated from people's experiences and beliefs in the afterlife. People who have been close to someone \"crossing over\" have reported that they often reach up towards the heavens and make mention of seeing something, usually interpreted as the Light of God. Nurses who have cared for the dying, and have heard people say they can't wait to leave, believe there is more beyond this life[2][3].

{"question": "Brainwaves. What are they? And can sounds of certain frequencies have an effect on them ? If so , why?", "answer": "Brainwaves are electrical signals that are generated by the neurons in the brain. They are measured in hertz (Hz) and can be divided into five categories: delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), beta (13-38Hz), and gamma (39-42Hz). Binaural beats are a type of sound wave that can influence the brain's brainwaves. This is achieved by playing two slightly different tones into each ear[1][4]. This causes the brain to interpret the sound waves as one tone with the difference in frequencies from each ear[4]. This can be used to produce specific, desired types of brainwaves, with the most common goal being to produce alpha waves, as they are linked to feelings of relaxation[4]. Additionally, soundwaves can be used to stimulate the brain and produce neurotransmitters, such as serotonin[2][4].", "references": ["Let us look at how exactly binaural beats affect our brain. Dr Suzanne Evans Morris states that when two different frequencies are played into each ear through different headphones, the difference between them determines the brainwave being influenced. For example, if a frequency of 210 Hz is played through one earphone and 200 Hz through the other, the brainwave that occurs is in the alpha zone, which is determined by the difference between the two frequencies, i.e., 10 Hz. The result of this is called \u201cbrainwave entrainment.\u201d", "Hence, when brainwaves can be influenced to a certain frequency corresponding to the five zones, brain function can accordingly be modified using sound. As a result, certain frequencies, sounds and music have the power to stimulate the brain, to even produce neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which is the \u201cfeel good\u201d chemical messenger, and can be utilized to increase pleasure and reduce feelings of pain. Different brainwave patterns are linked to the production of various neurochemicals which are associated with creativity, memory, relaxation, stress relief, increased learning, and other such desirable benefits.", "- Gamma: Gamma (39-42Hz) brainwaves are faster blips of subtle vibratory states, usually associated with regulating perception and consciousness.", "This phenomenon is the result of the brain\u2019s interpretation of two different tones being received by each ear. When two slightly different tones are played at the same time, the brain interprets the stimuli as one tone with the difference in frequencies from each ear. For example, if a 300 Hz tone was played in one ear, and a 250 Hz tone was played in the other, the brain would perceive a 50 Hz tone. The importance of this is that soundwaves in our environment can induce certain brainwaves; thus, binaural beats can be used to produce specific, desired types of brain waves. The most common goal of brain entrainment is to produce alpha waves, as they are linked to feelings of relaxation. Though most people produce these frequencies with their eyes closed, some cannot generate them naturally at all.", "- Beta: Beta (13-38Hz) brainwaves have a faster and shorter frequency, associated with levels of concentration or mental and intellectual activity.

Note that reflex responses are initiated by sensory stimuli that activate afferent neurons (e.g., somatosensory stimuli for the eye blink reflex and visual stimuli for the pupillary light reflex and accommodation responses).", "Dysfunction of the corneal \u201cblink\u201d reflex can occur from damage at any point in the pathway (i.e., central or peripheral nervous system). Peripherally damage causes ipsilateral reflex deficits while central dysfunctions have bilateral deficits.", "The accommodation reflex is important because it enables you to focus clearly on objects that are up close when you are shifting from viewing objects far off. All the three eye changes must happen for you to see the near objects clearly.", "The blink response causes the eyelid to close. This system works together with a secondary circuit pathway through the oculomotor nucleus to re-open the eyelid. This secondary pathway is activated by the same touch pathway used by the blink response (Trigeminal V1). To facilitate this response, V1 nerves have secondary inputs within the trigeminal spinal nucleus onto nerves that project to the oculomotor nucleus. These spinal nucleus/oculomotor neurons synapse onto oculomotor neurons that then activate the levator palpebrae. The oculomotor pathway initiates the eyelid to re-open after it closes in the blink response. It works in conjunction with the facial motor pathway."]}
{"question": "Why does a GPS unit require signal from at least 4 satellites in order to determine its position?", "answer": "A GPS unit requires signal from at least 4 satellites in order to determine its position because it needs information from at least 4 satellites to work out its position in 3-dimensions[1]. The GPS receiver determines its own location by measuring the time it takes for a signal to arrive at its location from at least four satellites[3][5]. The satellites transmit the exact time the signals are sent, so given the travel time of the GPS signals from three satellites and their exact position in the sky, the GPS receiver can determine the position in three dimensions[4][5]. Additionally, the GPS system needs to have incredibly precise clocks on the satellites and receivers, and must be able to access and interpret the signals from several orbiting satellites simultaneously[5].", "references": ["If the GPS receiver is only able to get signals from 3 satellites, you can still get your position, but it will be less accurate.

So given the travel time of the GPS signals from three satellites and their exact position in the sky, the GPS receiver can determine your position in three dimensions - east, north and altitude.", "GPS is a constellation of satellites that orbit approximately 11,000 miles above the Earth and transmit radio wave signals to receivers across the planet. By determining the time that it takes for a GPS satellite signal to reach your receiver, you can calculate your distance to the satellite and figure out your exact location on the Earth. Sound easy? In fact it is a very complicated process. For the GPS system to work, you need to have incredibly precise clocks on the satellites and receivers, and you must be able to access and interpret the signals from several orbiting satellites simultaneously. Fortunately, the receivers take care of all the calculations."]}

{"question": ";Why is it so easy to doze off during the day after(or at) work or class,but downright impossible at night?", "answer": "It is easier to doze off during the day after work or class because your body's production of melatonin, which helps you sleep, is influenced by light and dark[2]. During the day, the light helps to make your body more energized and alert, and the darkness associated with night-time can make it easier to fall asleep. Establishing a routine, such as an order of activities at bedtime, can help a person fall asleep, as well as changing the temperature or lighting in a bedroom[3]. Developing a relaxing bedtime routine to prepare your mind and body for sleep, such as taking a warm bath, reading, or listening to soothing music, and avoiding screens at least one hour before bedtime can help as well[4]. Additionally, avoiding drinking alcohol late at night can help improve your sleep cycles.", "references": ["While it\u2019s often impossible to take a nap on the job, taking a nap before work can help increase your alertness.

{"question": "Why do prisms split apart the different colors of light, but lenses don't?", "answer": "Prisms split apart the different colors of light because each color is characteristic of a distinct wave frequency and different frequencies of light waves bend varying amounts upon passage through a prism[1][4]. This is why when you shine a flashlight in a prism, the different colors get separated and you get a rainbow[1][4]. However, lenses don't disperse light as efficiently because convex lenses disperse light like prisms and that effect is known as chromatic aberration[2]. However, it is much less efficient than a prism because it is difficult to project an spectrum using a pair of common eyeglasses, a magnifier or even a photography objective[5].", "references": ["Prisms bend different colors different amounts. So when you shine a flashlight in, all of the different colors bend differently and get separated. (This is how you get a rainbow - by spreading the colors apart.) Lasers, on the other hand, are only one color. Some of them are only red and some of them are only green, but they\u2019re only that color. So when you shine a laser through a prism, there\u2019s nothing to be separated, and the light stays together. One thing that I think is pretty interesting to see is if you shine two different colors of lasers through a prism. Then the two laser beams spread apart from each other, but each one stays together with its own color.", "Sean E.

Visible light, also known as white light, consists of a collection of component colors. These colors are often observed as light passes through a triangular prism. Upon passage through the prism, the white light is separated into its component colors - red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. The separation of visible light into its different colors is known as dispersion. It was mentioned in the Light and Color unit that each color is characteristic of a distinct wave frequency; and different frequencies of light waves will bend varying amounts upon passage through a prism. In this unit, we will investigate the dispersion of light in more detail, pondering the reasons why different frequencies of light bend or refract different amounts when passing through the prism.", "I would add to his answer the reasons why usual convex lenses disperse light much less than a prisma does.

This explains why many mountains have a steeper side (the windward side) and a shallow, flat side, which displays the triangular features[5].

{"question": "How do steakhouse restaurants cook so many steaks at the same time to varying degrees of done-ness and get them all relatively correctly cooked for each customer?", "answer": "Steakhouse restaurants cook a lot of steaks at the same time to varying degrees of done-ness by using a quality product from a quality purveyor and allowing the steaks to come up to room temperature before cooking them on the char grill with the right amount of seasoning, to get a great char on the outside[3]. They also use timing to ensure the steaks are cooked correctly, noting which steak is which, substituting one steak for an order for another, and communicating with all the other cooks[4]. Additionally, they flip the steak multiple times\u2014as often as once every 15 seconds or so\u2014to not only end up with meat that's more evenly cooked, but also to cut down on cook time and develop a great crust on top of that[5].", "references": ["ELI5: How do steakhouse restaurants cook so many steaks at the same time to varying degrees of done-ness and get them all relatively correctly cooked for each customer?", "False.

{"question": "Why is it harder to open a refrigerator door the second time after closing the door to the refrigerator before hand?", "answer": "The difficulty in opening a refrigerator door the second time after closing it has to do with air pressure.

{"question": "Why does English no longer have a strong culture of poetry?", "answer": "English poetry no longer has a strong culture because the English language has been widely used outside of England, with a number of major national poetries emerging and developing[1]. In addition, the original traits of Old English poetry, which were based on heroic themes and codes of conduct, are no longer relevant in today\u2019s multicultural English society[2][3].

The king must follow a code of royal generosity, rewarding his faithful followers.

More recently, the habit of looking at poems has encouraged the production of a toneless free-verse line whose length is determined merely by its visual relationship to other lines on the page.

{"question": "Why Should I Inhale and Exhale at Certain Points While Doing Abdominal Exercises?", "answer": "Inhaling and exhaling at certain points while doing abdominal exercises is important for several reasons. First, breathing helps stabilize the torso and allows muscles on the front such as the rectus abdominis and obliques to do their job easily[1]. Secondly, it is necessary to follow the principle of breathing (inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth) during abdominal exercises to get the maximum effect[2]. Additionally, inhalation during abdominal exercise can help with respiratory training, especially for those with disease states[3]. Lastly, exhalation is important during weight lifting because it reduces the amount of pressure in the abdomen and decreases the chances of sustaining internal injuries such as hernias and vessel strains[4]. Lastly, belly breathing (using the entire abdominal area for oxygen instead of just the top of the chest) can give you more energy for cardiovascular exercise[5].", "references": ["During core and abdominal exercises, it's common to stop breathing as you crunch your body in half or pull your belly in tight. But keep breathing to help stabilize your torso. Breathing \"allows the muscles on the front \u2014 such as the rectus abdominis and obliques \u2014 to do their job easily and maintain this balancing position longer,\" explains Denzel. In other words, it makes your plank more effective.", "The principle of correct breathing when bending the abdomen is that when there is a muscle contraction, then exhale and when the muscle relaxes (without force), inhale; inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Whether the sit-ups on the machine, with equipment or without equipment, it is necessary to follow this principle of breathing to get the maximum effect of the exercise.", "Additional fatigue induced via inhalation during abdominal exercise can prove to be important in various areas of respiratory training. Those in disease states may benefit from this type of training if this activity is implemented during any core exercise they may employ. Further study of the idea (core training with inhalation) needs to be investigated in order to give validity to these claims. While sit-ups invoke activity in muscles other than the abdominal groups, we chose that exercise based on our preliminary work (Strongoli et al., 2008) which showed the highest transdiaphragmatic pressures and highest likelihood of activating the diaphragm during the activity.", "Based on these two studies, it is clear that exhalation is an important part of breathing during weight lifting. By reducing the amount of pressure in the abdomen, exhaling during lifting decreases the chances of sustaining internal injuries such as hernias and vessel strains which can be caused by excessive internal pressure. Exhaling relieves that pressure by releasing some of the accumulated air from the abdomen, ensuring that the abdominal pressure does not reach an unsafe level. So, next time you go to the gym to bench press, remember to exhale when pressing and inhale before letting the weight down onto your chest to regulate pressure build-up in your chest and abdomen.", "Be a \"belly breather,\" says Susan Shane, licensed acupuncturist and creator of Exaircise , which teaches people how to breathe deeply. Use the entire abdominal area for oxygen, not just the top of your chest. You'll have more energy to finish because air is fuel for the aerobic system that your body uses during cardiovascular exercise."]}

{"question": "How does a car engine (or any engine) works, and what is the difference between a turbo charger and a super charger?", "answer": "An engine works by taking in air and fuel, compressing them together and igniting them to create an explosion that powers the car. Turbochargers and superchargers are called forced induction systems, as they compress the air flowing into the engine in order to increase power[2]. The key difference between a turbo charger and a super charger is that a supercharger requires engine power to run, while a turbocharger runs off waste (exhaust) energy created by the engine[1][4]. This means that overall turbochargers operate with higher efficiency, utilising exhaust energy which is typically lost in naturally-aspirated and supercharged engines[1].", "references": ["Besides how the two devices work (explained above) another key difference is that whilst a supercharger requires engine power to run, a turbocharger runs off waste (exhaust) energy created by the engine.

Both turbochargers and superchargers are called forced induction systems. They compress the air flowing into the engine\u00ad (see How Car Engines Work for a description of airflow in a normal engine). The advantage of compressing the air is that it lets the engine stuff more air into a cylinder.

Their cheap production requires constraints on set design and lighting, causing them to look different from other forms of television. And while some viewers may not notice the differences, a Season 2 episode of Friends parodying the genre made them abundantly clear.", "The soap opera effect is the result of budget limits and production constraints which soap operas are produced under - including the cameras and lenses used to capture soap opera performances. As daylight television does not receive as many viewers as evening programs, less advertising revenue is generated, and hence, less money is spent on the productions. The primary contributing feature which is responsible for the \"soap opera look\" is the lighting of the scene which needs only to be adequate for coverage, as opposed to maximized for consistent aesthetic appeal. As far as I know, soap operas have never been shot on film - except for maybe rare exterior shots in more popular series such as The Guiding Light (which also was the first show to start shooting in HD in 2008). The idea is to spend as little as possible and like their radio counterparts, the emphasis was on live performances.", "Despite creating a unique visual style out of budget constraints, soap operas have made the most out of their limits, using these traits to their advantage. The effects of cost-effective lighting and motion interpolation have led these programs to rely heavily on close-ups and frequent cuts, which goes well with their character-driven and dialogue-heavy style. Even as the years go by, this style has proved to be timeless, as soap operas retain their iconic visual effects, even in the digital age.", "Some of the differences in quality were actually adaptations to make the shooting cheaper. For example, to get a soft glow around characters, production crews on old soap operas would smear a thin layer of petroleum jelly over the camera lens. The lower budget also meant that the sets were typically smaller, so soap opera producers had to adapt their lighting to the smaller sized set. Additionally, before the 1970s and shows like Days of Our Lives and General Hospital, many soap operas were broadcast live; the lack of multiple takes and the stationary cameras gave audiences the feeling of watching a play."]}

{"question": "Why there's always a period of time before takeoff when there's no air conditioning on the plane.", "answer": "Before takeoff, there is no air conditioning on the plane for several reasons. Firstly, the APU (Auxillary Power Unit) needs to be started in order to provide electricity and allow the aircraft to be disconnected from ground power, as well as provide the air needed to start the main engines and operate the air conditioning system[2]. Secondly, there may be delays in preparing the aircraft, such as not having it cleaned on time, which can affect the boarding time[3]. Lastly, the engines need to be run every seven days to keep them functional and the air conditioning switched on to keep the humidity at bay[4], and humidity needs to be kept low to prevent the spread of viruses.", "references": ["- The committee reiterates the recommendation of the 1986 NRC report that a regulation be established that requires removal of passengers from an aircraft within 30 min after a ventilation failure or shutdown on the ground and that full ventilation be maintained whenever on-board or ground-based air-conditioning is available.", "Before each flight, the pilots will check on the weather and departure procedures and making sure the aircraft is fit to fly, has enough fuel and isn't overweight. Ground staff will be loading checked baggage and cargo into the cargo hold under the passenger cabin, which can cause loud bangs and the aircraft to shake. You may also hear a small jet engine start up in the tail of the aircraft; This is the auxillary power unit (APU), which provides electricity and allows the aircraft to be disconnected from ground power. The APU also provides the air needed to start the main engines and operate the air conditioning system, so its start will be accompanied by the air conditioning coming on.", "Once again, there are a lot of things that can delay the preparation of the aircraft, and consequently, its take off on time.

{"question": "Whats the physics behind pumping your arms when you run?", "answer": "Pumping your arms while running helps to reduce the overall metabolic cost of running by helping to balance the moving body, increase forward propulsion or, perhaps, provide a bit of bounce, helping to lift us off the ground with each stride[2]. According to Newton's Third Law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and pumping your arms helps to generate more force and momentum, which results in increased speed[3].

{"question": "Why do some planes leave a trail of condensation/mist behind? What causes these trails?", "answer": "White trails from airplanes, commonly referred to as condensation trails or contrails, are created when the exhaust from a plane's engine combines with the low-temperature and low-vapor-pressure atmosphere at high altitude[1]. These trails form when water vapor condenses and freezes around small particles from the engine exhaust[1][2][5], and their appearance will depend on the humidity[1][3]. Contrails are actually a type of cirrus cloud and can stay around for a long time if the air is wet and cold enough[5].", "references": ["White trails from airplanes are often called condensation trails or contrails, but they could also be called clouds. The main reason behind their appearance is the temperature difference between hot humid air around a plane\u2019s engine and low temperatures outside the aircraft.

The atmosphere at high altitude is of much lower vapor pressure and temperature than the exhaust gas from a plane\u2019s working engine. Besides water vapor, the exhaust also contains carbon dioxide, oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, unburned fuel, metal particles and soot, which provides condensation sites for the water vapor.", "As some aircraft fly through the sky, they leave trails of what appears to be smoke. Though do not be concerned, the trails are mostly condensation- hence the name \"condensation trails\". As the engine burns, it ejects a large amount of water and some aerosols into the air. Contrails are created when water vapor condenses and freezes around small particles generated from the engine exhaust. Both the particles and water lead to the generation of contrails.", "Will the white trails appear in the air depends on the humidity. If a plane flies over a region with dry air, there are no small particles of water in the air and nothing to freeze outside. There will either be no condensation trails from the aircraft in such areas at all or they will be very pale and disappear quickly. Besides, white trails do not form after airplanes and helicopters that fly at low altitudes.

{"question": "Why do scrapes and other injuries feel more painful when its cold outside?", "answer": "Cold weather can make scrapes and other injuries feel more painful for several reasons. Cold weather can cause skin to dry out and crack, and also make existing injuries worse by causing an already bothersome muscle or tendon to tense up or tighten[1]. Cold weather can also force your muscles to work harder to complete the same tasks they could more easily perform in warmer weather, resulting in more soreness and muscle damage[3]. In addition, decreased levels of exercise during winter months, pain receptors at trauma sites becoming more susceptible to cold and increased pain susceptibility as a result of chronic disease may also contribute to the feeling of increased pain due to cold weather[4].", "references": ["Less efficient muscles and a slower reaction time can lead to a higher rate of injury in the cold, especially during fast-paced activities like sports.

{"question": "So humans regenerate skin cells and all, and that's cool, but if we constantly make new skin cells, why do I still have freckles, when birthmarks might fade over time?", "answer": "Freckles are the result of an overproduction of melanin, a pigment that gives our skin, hair, and eyes their color[3]. Melanin also protects our skin from sun damage by absorbing and reflecting UV light[4]. Frequent sunburns and a gene known as MC1R, which provides instructions for making melanin, can lead to the overproduction of melanin and thus, freckles[2].

{"question": "Why do trees/coral constantly grow while humans and most other animals stop growing as adults?", "answer": "Trees and coral are able to constantly grow while humans and most other animals stop growing as adults because they have what is known as \"indeterminate growth\". This means that they will keep growing until they die, and their growth is not limited by a predetermined life span[3]. Trees, for example, get taller and thicker with age as long as they have access to resources[3]. Corals also grow in winter and summer due to seasonal changes in ocean temperature, pH, availability of nutrients and differences in light irradiance[4]. Lastly, coral reefs are able to grow and maintain their large size due to a mutual exchange between the tiniest ocean animals and plants which has been going on for 25 million years[5].", "references": ["Like other animals and many living things, we humans grow when we're young and then stop growing once we mature.

A 2001 study discovered one that hadn't had a significant mutation in its pollen or seeds over 4,700 years. At some point, the trees stop getting taller, but they will continue to thicken at the trunk as long as they have access to resources. Some animals have what's called \"Negligible Senescence,\" which means they don't seem to age. Evolution didn't program a natural limit to their lives. Animals discovered to have this are tortoises, sharks, turtles, whales, and some types of fish. A Rougheye Rockfish was caught and determined to be 205 years old.

{"question": "Why are people scared of bugs?", "answer": "People may be scared of bugs due to their alien appearance, operating in large swarms or colonies, which can overwhelm the human psyche and damage the highly valued human beliefs regarding individuality[1]. People may also fear bugs because, even though they are much smaller than humans and can be easily squashed, they are still unfamiliar and potentially dangerous[3]. Additionally, some bugs bite or sting and can spread diseases[5], which can be a source of fear for people.[1][4]", "references": ["Lastly, people may fear bugs because they look so different from us. Humans and bugs do not share a close evolutionary bond, which makes many bugs appear otherworldly. In addition to their alien appearance, bugs can also scare us when we witness them operating in large swarms or colonies. The reason for this, according to some researchers, is because seeing a large amount of bugs in one place can overwhelm the human psyche and can damage the highly valued human beliefs regarding individuality. Seeing a swarm of locusts all working together can serve to undermine a person's belief about what they can accomplish on their own. This particular theory was born out of a specific school of psychoanalysis, so this way of thinking about fear is not as common as most.", "If you think about it, being scared of a bug is a bit strange. After all, humans are so much bigger than bugs. We can simply squash them. Most bugs aren't likely to do us any harm whatsoever. And yet we remain terrified of spiders, centipedes, grasshoppers, and all sorts of other bugs.", "Also, people do not fear certain arthropods, such as spiders, because they pose the same sort of threats as lions and bears. We don't think that bugs can overpower and kill us like other larger and aggressive animals. Instead our fear of bugs is closely related to the feeling of disgust. Researchers studying how disgust and fear are related use the term \"rejection response\" to describe the human tendency to keep something unfamiliar, and/or disgusting, far away from us. Much like how we are disgusted by feces and rotting food due to their potential to make us sick, we are also disgusted and avoid bugs for their potential to make us ill. Cockroaches, for example, are one of the most feared arthropods, and for good reason, they are disgusting. It is likely that we find cockroaches more disgusting and fear inspiring than most other bugs because cockroaches actually can spread disease due to their love of rotten food, among other reasons.", "Even a guy who makes his living studying bugs, in other words, is not immune to their strange, terrifying power. And it is strange: We know, rationally, that most of these tiny creatures can\u2019t hurt us, and yet we shriek when they land on our skin, give them prominent roles in our horror movies, and spend a ton of time and money to rid them from our homes. There\u2019s an entry in the DSM-5 for an extreme fear of insects \u2014 it\u2019s called entemophobia, and can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy \u2014 but even when it hasn\u2019t reached pathological levels, the fear is real and widespread. In Chapman University\u2019s 2016 Survey on American Fears, 25 percent of respondents said they were afraid of insects and/or spiders. That\u2019s more than the number of people who feared becoming the victim of a violent crime, germs, or even dying. Why is something so small and harmless considered so scary?", "Some researchers believe the fear of bugs is rooted in the fact that, in reality, some of them can be harmful. Some bugs bite or sting. Others can carry diseases. To the extent that a fear of bugs protects us from harm, it's not necessarily a bad thing."]}
{"question": "Why does \"modern art\" tend to be more about the idea behind the art instead of the art itself?", "answer": "Modern art tends to be more about the idea behind the art instead of the art itself because modern art is marked by innovation, experiment, and an almost dogmatic belief in reason and progress, pushing the artist to discover new forms of art, innovating their style, medium and subject matter, freeing themselves from academic conventions, and abolishing tradition in their quest for modern art[1].

{"question": "Why do things physically hurt more when we are cold?", "answer": "There are several reasons why things physically hurt more when we are cold. One is that the nerves in your hand get much more sensitive and your veins constrict, leading to less blood flow to your extremities, making skin more rigid and applying pressure to sensitive nerves[4]. Also, cold temperatures can trigger a body's chemical response to anxiety or depression, amplifying joint pain[1]. Additionally, the body's natural reaction to extremely cold temperatures is to tell the brain that it is in pain as a form of protection[2].

A great example of these conditions is rheumatoid arthritis.", "The nerves in your hand get much more sensitive when they're cold. Also, your veins constrict, and blood runs less to your extremities and more to your vital organs to preserve heat. This makes your skin more rigid, which causes pressure to be applied to these already sensitive nerves. So everything is getting less blood flow, which also makes it harder to make precise or repetitive movements (texting when it's cold). So all these make for a more painful experience when your fingers get hit when they're really cold. Compare the warm, soft hands with good padding and flexibility to cold, rigid, blood-deprived hands.

Earth's moon, the longest known of all, was given the name \"Selene\" by the Greeks and \"Luna\" by the Romans, each a goddess. The ancient Germans called it \"Man\" or \"Mani\" and had a myth about a miserable person of this name who, together with his sister (the sun), is being pursued by a hound across the skies until the end of the world. From this myth derive the Germanic words \"mane\" (Danish), \"maan\" (Dutch), \"moon\" (English) and \"mond\" (German), later transferred to all celestial bodies circulating around planets.", "Earth's moon does have a name: In English, it's \"the moon.\" The word moon is Proto-Germanic in origin, deriving from a similar-sounding word that came into use a few thousand years ago in Northern Europe.", "The only other exception to this naming convention are the decidedly generic sounding names of the Earth and Moon. Since we\u2019ve already explained how the Earth came to be known as such, that just leaves us with why our largest satellite doesn\u2019t have a more colourful name like the moons of the other planets in our solar system.", "When humanity first learned of other moons orbiting the planets in our solar system, one of the primary reasons they were given names was to differentiate them from the Moon, which, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the entity tasked with naming every celestial body in the night sky, is still the official name of our moon in English."]}
{"question": "Why do countries have different voltage for appliances ?", "answer": "The different voltages used in different countries are rooted in the history of electrical power generation[1]. Europe originally used 120V, just like Japan and the US today, but it was deemed necessary to increase voltage to get more power with fewer losses and less voltage drop from the same copper wire diameter[2]. The US decided not to change due to the cost involved to replace all electric appliances[2]. Many nations also use different plugs and a number of plug adapter kits are available for connecting to foreign plugs, but connecting to foreign plugs without a transformer or voltage converter can result in fireworks[3]. It is also important to check if the device is capable of handling the lower 50 hertz cycle found in much of the world or the higher 220 volts of electricity[3]. The different voltage standards are believed to be rooted in a feud between Tesla and Edison[5].", "references": ["You can see an up-to-date list of the different residential and three-phase voltages used in each country here.

In addition, some electrical devices cannot handle the lower 50 hertz cycle found in much of the world, and may experience difficulties.", "Many travelers to Europe have had difficulties with their electronics, because European and American power systems are run differently. Most of the world, including Europe, uses a 220 volt/50 hertz system. A handful of other countries, including the United States, have 110 volt/60 hertz electricity, which is believed to be safer. As a result, appliances in these nations are designed to connect to a specific type of power source, and using American devices in European outlets and vice versa can result in havoc.", "Many countries around the world use different standards in feeding electricity to residents. The U.S. for example, uses 110V 60Hz AC current, whereas India uses 230V 50Hz AC current.

{"question": "I've read that quantum computers can easily break all our current security protocols. How do they do this?", "answer": "Quantum computers can break the encryption we use to protect emails, bank accounts, and other sensitive data by running algorithms such as Grover's Algorithm and Shor's Algorithm[3]. Grover's Algorithm weakens the standard symmetric algorithms, so key size can be doubled to protect against it[3]. Shor's Algorithm, on the other hand, completely breaks all the standard asymmetric algorithms at any key size[3]. This means an attacker can recover the key being used and decrypt the traffic or impersonate the peer without attacking the symmetric algorithm at all[3]. As a result, new asymmetric algorithms that are secure against quantum computers need to be developed[3][4]. While quantum computing will break much of our current encryption methods, it is not yet practical enough to cause significant damage[5].", "references": ["A group of researchers has claimed that quantum computers can now crack the encryption we use to protect emails, bank accounts and other sensitive data.

But researchers might also discover better quantum algorithms in the future that can beat these systems, with calamitous consequences.", "This brings us to quantum computers. The best known quantum computing algorithms weaken (see: Grover's Algorithm) the standard symmetric algorithms, which means that you can protect yourself -- or so it seems -- by doubling the key size, which is practical. However, they completely break (see: Shor's Algorithm) all the standard asymmetric algorithms, more or less at any key size. If the asymmetric algorithms are broken, then the attacker can just recover the key you are using and decrypt your traffic (or impersonate the peer) without attacking the symmetric algorithm at all, which is obviously catastrophic. In other words, we need some new asymmetric algorithms which are secure even against quantum computers.", "As should be clear from the above, we're nowhere near ready for a post-quantum future: effectively all Internet communications security depends on algorithms that are susceptible to quantum computers. If a practical quantum computer that could break common asymmetric cryptography were released today, it would be extremely bad; exactly how bad would depend on how many people could get one. We in principle have the tools to rebuild our protocols using post-quantum algorithms, albeit at some pretty serious cost, but we're years away from doing so, and even on an emergency basis it would take quite some time to make a switch. On the other hand, it's also possible that we won't get practical quantum computers for years to come -- if ever -- and that we'll have good post-quantum algorithms ready for deployment or even deployed long before that.", "What it boils down to is quantum computing will break much, but not all of our current encryption methods. But, there's no reason to panic yet. Unless you're got your retirement funds tied up in Bitcoin -- then, I'd be a bit concerned."]}

{"question": "Why is cheese such a big deal to the French?", "answer": "Cheese has been a part of French cuisine and culture for centuries, and there are several reasons why it is so important. One is that the French have an obsession with rules when it comes to classifying and eating food, which helps to preserve the product and associated traditions that are distinctly French in the face of globalization[1]. Another reason is that cheese is viewed as a symbol of French national identity, and there is an emphasis on consuming cheese in the \"proper\" way[4]. Finally, cheese originated as a peasant food in medieval times and has since become popular around the world, leading to a desire to protect the authenticity of French cheeses[5].", "references": ["Still, despite its relatively long presence in France, exactly why cheese is so important in French cuisine and culture is a bit of a mystery. One interesting study suggests that there could be several reasons, including the French obsession with rules when it comes to classifying and eating food, a desire to hold onto a product and associated traditions that are distinctly French in the face of globalization, and resistance to fast food culture.", "The authors of the study admit that their research is only based on contemporary subjects, as opposed to, say, an examination of the evolving role of cheese in French culture over the centuries (which, if you\u2019re looking for a thesis paper topic, I\u2019d urge you to consider), so these probably aren\u2019t the only reasons why the French consider cheese so important and such a quintessential part of their culture. But it\u2019s a start.", "Thus, the third sub-hypothesis is that the French attitude toward cheese includes strong agreement that it is a person's \"duty\" to be educated about cheese and to understand the proper ways of consuming cheese.", "The second factor seems to represent the importance of cheese to the French national lifestyle. Measures loading on this factor include the idea that farm cheese is best, that life could not be completely appreciated without cheese, and that without her cheeses France would be just another country. Two items from other factors load here as well. One is that cheese is a symbol of France; the other addresses an unwillingness to place processed cheese on the same plate with \"real\" cheese. If cheese represents French national identity, the purity of the symbol is important.", "So why is cheese such a big deal here? Strangely, it originated as 'peasant food' in medieval times, when meat was a luxury, but people could curdle, treat and store milk to make this product that would keep for a long time, providing vital sustenance during the harsh winter. But as French cheeses became popular in the modern era, too many people started staking claim to the good stuff and making poor or inauthentic varieties around the world."]}

{"question": "The Second Postulate of Special Relativity.", "answer": "The second postulate of special relativity states that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers in all inertial frames of reference, regardless of the motion of the light source.

{"question": "How are things sticky?", "answer": "Adhesives are substances that can hold materials together by surface attachment and can broadly be defined as liquids, solids, or pastes[3]. The stickiness of adhesives is due to their viscoelastic properties, meaning they exhibit some of the characteristics of liquids, and so they will 'wet' a surface to which they are pressed and then, because of their elasticity, they will resist separation when stressed[4].

This property means that they exhibit some of the characteristics of liquids, and so they will 'wet' a surface to which they are pressed. But then, because of their elasticity, they will resist separation when stressed. Thus, 'stickiness' is strictly a physical (viscoelastic) phenomenon, not a chemical one.\"", "It's the same for lots of other kinds of glue.

{"question": "I've heard that no matter where you are in the universe, you're still equidistant from the universe's \"edges\" as it expands. How is this so?

Therefore, no matter where you are in the Universe, you are always equidistant from the \"edges\" as it expands because space is expanding between all objects, creating more space in between them. This expansion has been happening for 18.9 Billion years, so it is impossible for us to reach the edge of the Universe even if we could travel at the speed of light[3]. The Universe is not like a ball, but rather it is like a flat grid, where the \"expansion\" just means that the distances between objects on the grid are getting larger[4].

{"question": "How come humans generally get into cold water slowly and uncomfortably, but animals jump in with no hesitation?", "answer": "Humans generally get into cold water slowly and uncomfortably, because of the body's involuntary response to cold water shock[2][3], which is characterized by a sudden gasp, rapid breathing and increased heart rate and blood pressure. This response is even more extreme when your airways are underwater when you need to breathe, or if you suffer from an underlying heart or vascular condition[2]. With each exposure, the body adapts and the effects of cold water shock are reduced[3][4], but humans are tropical animals and have evolved to be comfortable in an ambient air temperature of about 28C[4], so cold water can still be a shock to the system.

{"question": "SMPTE Timecode", "answer": "SMPTE timecode is a set of cooperating standards to label individual frames of video or film with a timecode[3]. It is presented in hour:minute:second:frame format and is typically represented in 32 bits using binary-coded decimal[1]. It is defined by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers in the SMPTE 12M specification[3]. There are also drop-frame and color framing flags and three extra binary group flag bits used for defining the use of the user bits[1]. Other varieties of SMPTE timecode can include extra information in a variety of encodings[1]. It is also used to create a control track longitudinal timecode (CTL timecode), which is SMPTE timecode embedded in the control track of a video tape[5].", "references": ["SMPTE timecode is presented in hour:minute:second:frame format and is typically represented in 32 bits using binary-coded decimal.

{"question": "Can imaginary numbers be represented visually?", "answer": "Yes, imaginary numbers can be represented visually. They can be represented as a pair of numbers (a, b) forming a vector on a diagram called an Argand diagram, representing the complex plane[3]. Additionally, they can be thought of as vectors and can be calculated with using all our rules for manipulating vectors[2]. Imaginary numbers can also model anything that rotates between two dimensions \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d[4], or anything with a cyclic, circular relationship[4].", "references": ["It seems to me that most math I have learnt (roughly up to precalculus) can be represented visually or geometrically. Calculus can give you areas under curves, algebra deals with conics, trigonometry deals with triangles etc.. For this reason I have always found it difficult to deal with imaginary numbers, as they would seem to imply the existence of a square with with negative area (the side length of a square is $\\sqrt{A}$, and as $\\sqrt{-1} = i \\implies i^2 = -1 = A$). Thus in order to better understand imaginary numbers I was wondering if there are any geometric, visual or every-day-life representations of imaginary numbers that would satisfy my empirical brain?", "Now that complex numbers can be represented visually in this way, they can be thought of as vectors and can be calculated with using all our rules for manipulating vectors.
